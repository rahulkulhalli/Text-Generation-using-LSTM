              "'now,fair hippolyta,our nuptial hour draws on apace : four happy days bring in another moon;but o ! methinks how slow this old moon wanes;she lingers my desires,like to a step dame,or a dowager long withering out a young man\\'s revenue.four days will quickly steep themselves in night;four nights will quickly dream away the time;and then the moon,like to a silver bow new-bent in heaven,shall behold the night of our solemnities. go,philostrate,stir up the athenian youth to merriments;awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;turn melancholy forth to funerals;the pale companion is not for our pomp.hippolyta,i woo\\'d thee with my sword,and won thy love doing thee injuries;but i will wed thee in another key,with pomp,with triumph,and with revelling.happy be theseus,our renowned duke !thanks,good egeus : what\\'s the news with thee ?full of vexation come i,with complaint against my child,my daughter hermia.stand forth,demetrius.my noble lord,this man hath my consent to marry her.stand forth,lysander : and,my gracious duke,this man hath bewitch\\'d the bosom of my child :thou,thou,lysander,thou hast given her rimes,and interchang\\'d love-tokens with my child;thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,with feigning voice,verses of feigning love;and stol\\'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair,rings,gawds,conceits,knacks,trifles,nosegays,sweetmeats,messengers of strong prevailment in unharden\\'d youth;with cunning hast thou filch\\'d my daughter\\'s heart;turn\\'d her obedience,which is due to me,to stubborn harshness.and,my gracious duke,be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius,i beg the ancient privilege of athens,as she is mine,i may dispose of her;which shall be either to this gentleman,or to her death,according to our law immediately provided in that case.what say you,hermia ? be advis\\'d,fair maid.to you,your father should be as a god;one that compos\\'d your beauties,yea,and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted,and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it.demetrius is a worthy gentleman.so is lysander.in himself he is;but,in this kind,wanting your father\\'s voice,the other must be held the worthier.i would my father look\\'d but with my eyes.rather your eyes must with his judgment look.i do entreat your grace to pardon me.i know not by what power i am made bold,nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts;but i beseech your grace,that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case,if i refuse to wed demetrius.either to die the death,or to abjure for ever the society of men.therefore,fair hermia,question your desires;know of your youth,examine well your blood,whe\\'r,if you yield not to your father\\'s choice,you can endure the livery of a nun,for aye to be in shady cloister mew\\'d,to live a barren sister all your life,chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.thrice blessed they that master so their blood,to undergo such maiden pilgrimage;but earthlier happy is the rose distill\\'d,than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows,lives,and dies,in single blessedness.so will i grow,so live,so die,my lord,ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship,whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty.take time to pause;and,by the next new moon,the sealing-day betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship,upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father\\'s will,or else to wed demetrius,as he would;or on diana\\'s altar to protest for aye austerity and single life.relent,sweet hermia;and,lysander,yield thy crazed title to my certain right.you have her father\\'s love,demetrius;let me have hermia\\'s : do you marry him.scornful lysander ! true,he hath my love,and what is mine my love shall render him;and she is mine,and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius.i am,my lord,as well deriv\\'d as he,as well possess\\'d;my love is more than his;my fortunes every way as fairly rank\\'d if not with vantage,as demetrius\\';and,which is more than all these boasts can be,i am belov\\'d of beauteous hermia.why should not i then prosecute my right ?demetrius,i\\'ll avouch it to his head,made love to nedar\\'s daughter,helena,and won her soul;and she,sweet lady,dotes,devoutly dotes,dotes in idolatry,upon this spotted and inconstant man.i must confess that i have heard so much,and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;but,being over-full of self-affairs,my mind did lose it.but,demetrius,come;and come,egeus;you shall go with me,i have some private schooling for you both.for you,fair hermia,look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father\\'s will,or else the law of athens yields you up,which by no means we may extenuate,to death,or to a vow of single life.come,my hippolyta : what cheer,my love ?demetrius and egeus,go along :i must employ you in some business against our nuptial,and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves.with duty and desire we follow you.how now,my love ! why is your cheek so pale ?how chance the roses there do fade so fast ?belike for want of rain,which i could well beteem them from the tempest of mine eyes.ay me ! for aught that ever i could read,could ever hear by tale or history,the course of true love never did run smooth;but,either it was different in blood,o cross ! too high to be enthrall\\'d to low.or else misgraffed in respect of years,o spite ! too old to be engag\\'d to young.or else it stood upon the choice of friends,o hell ! to choose love by another\\'s eye.or,if there were a sympathy in choice,war,death,or sickness did lay siege to it,making it momentany as a sound,swift as a shadow,short as any dream,brief as the lightning in the collied night,that,in a spleen,unfolds both heaven and earth,and ere a man hath power to say,\\'behold !\\' the jaws of darkness do devour it up :so quick bright things come to confusion.if then true lovers have been ever cross\\'d,it stands as an edict in destiny :then let us teach our trial patience,because it is a customary cross,as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,wishes and tears,poor fancy\\'s followers.a good persuasion : therefore,hear me,hermia.i have a widow aunt,a dowager of great revenue,and she hath no child :from athens is her house remote seven leagues;and she respects me as her only son.there,gentle hermia,may i marry thee,and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us.if thou lov\\'st me then,steal forth thy father\\'s house to-morrow night,and in the wood,a league without the town,where i did meet thee once with helena,to do observance to a morn of may,there will i stay for thee.my good lysander !i swear to thee by cupid\\'s strongest bow,by his best arrow with the golden head,by the simplicity of venus\\' doves,by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,and by that fire which burn\\'d the carthage queen,when the false troyan under sail was seen,by all the vows that ever men have broke,in number more than ever women spoke,in that same place thou hast appointed me,to-morrow truly will i meet with thee.keep promise,love.look,here comes helena.god speed fair helena ! whither away ?call you me fair ? that fair again unsay.demetrius loves your fair : o happy fair !your eyes are lode-stars ! and your tongue\\'s sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherd\\'s ear,when wheat is green,when hawthorn buds appear.sickness is catching : o ! were favour so,yours would i catch,fair hermia,ere i go;my ear should catch your voice,my eye your eye,my tongue should catch your tongue\\'s sweet melody.were the world mine,demetrius being bated,the rest i\\'d give to be to you translated.o ! teach me how you look,and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius\\' heart.i frown upon him,yet he loves me still.o ! that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill.i give him curses,yet he gives me love.o ! that my prayers could such affection move.the more i hate,the more he follows me.the more i love,the more he hateth me.his folly,helena,is no fault of mine.none,but your beauty : would that fault were mine !take comfort : he no more shall see my face;lysander and myself will fly this place.before the time i did lysander see,seem\\'d athens as a paradise to me :o ! then,what graces in my love do dwell,that he hath turn\\'d a heaven unto a hell.helen,to you our minds we will unfold.to-morrow night,when ph be doth behold her silver visage in the wat\\'ry glass,decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,a time that lovers\\' flights doth still conceal,through athens\\' gates have we devis\\'d to steal.and in the wood,where often you and i upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,there my lysander and myself shall meet;and thence from athens turn away our eyes,to seek new friends and stranger companies.farewell,sweet playfellow : pray thou for us;and good luck grant thee thy demetrius !keep word,lysander : we must starve our sight from lovers\\' food till morrow deep midnight.i will,my hermia.helena,adieu :as you on him,demetrius dote on you !how happy some o\\'er other some can be !through athens i am thought as fair as she;but what of that ? demetrius thinks not so;he will not know what all but he do know;and as he errs,doting on hermia\\'s eyes,so i,admiring of his qualities.things base and vile,holding no quantity,love can transpose to form and dignity.love looks not with the eyes,but with the mind,and therefore is wing\\'d cupid painted blind.nor hath love\\'s mind of any judgment taste;wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste :and therefore is love said to be a child,because in choice he is so oft beguil\\'d.as waggish boys in game themselves forswear,so the boy love is perjur\\'d every where;for ere demetrius look\\'d on hermia\\'s eyne,he hail\\'d down oaths that he was only mine;and when this hail some heat from hermia felt,so he dissolv\\'d,and showers of oaths did melt.i will go tell him of fair hermia\\'s flight :then to the wood will he to-morrow night pursue her;and for this intelligence if i have thanks,it is a dear expense :but herein mean i to enrich my pain,to have his sight thither and back again.is all our company here ?you were best to call them generally,man by man,according to the scrip.here is the scroll of every man\\'s name,which is thought fit,through all athens,to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding-day at night.first,good peter quince,say what the play treats on;then read the names of the actors,and so grow to a point.marry,our play is,the most lamentable comedy,and most cruel death of pyramus and thisby.a very good piece of work,i assure you,and a merry.now,good peter quince,call forth your actors by the scroll.masters,spread yourselves.answer as i call you.nick bottom,the weaver.ready.name what part i am for,and proceed.you,nick bottom,are set down for pyramus.what is pyramus ? a lover,or a tyrant ?a lover,that kills himself most gallantly for love.that will ask some tears in the true performing of it : if i do it,let the audience look to their eyes;i will move storms,i will condole in some measure.to the rest : yet my chief humour is for a tyrant.i could play ercles rarely,or a part to tear a cat in,to make all split.the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates :and phibbus\\' car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates.this was lofty ! now name the rest of the players.this is ercles\\' vein,a tyrant\\'s vein;a lover is more condoling.francis flute,the bellows-mender.here,peter quince.you must take thisby on you.what is thisby ? a wandering knight ?it is the lady that pyramus must love.nay,faith,let not me play a woman;i have a beard coming.that\\'s all one : you shall play it in a mask,and you may speak as small as you will.an i may hide my face,let me play thisby too.i\\'ll speak in a monstrous little voice,\\'thisne,thisne !\\' \\'ah,pyramus,my lover dear;thy thisby dear,and lady dear !\\' no,no;you must play pyramus;and flute,you thisby.well,proceed.robin starveling,the tailor.here,peter quince.robin starveling,you must play thisby\\'s mother.tom snout,the tinker.here,peter quince.you,pyramus\\'s father;myself,thisby\\'s father;snug,the joiner,you the lion\\'s part : and,i hope,here is a play fitted.have you the lion\\'s part written ? pray you,if it be,give it me,for i am slow of study.you may do it extempore,for it is nothing but roaring.let me play the lion too.i will roar,that i will do any man\\'s heart good to hear me;i will roar,that i will make the duke say,\\'let him roar again,let him roar again.\\' an you should do it too terribly,you would fright the duchess and the ladies,that they would shriek;and that were enough to hang us all.that would hang us,every mother\\'s son.i grant you,friends,if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits,they would have no more discretion but to hang us;but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove;i will roar you as \\'twere any nightingale.you can play no part but pyramus;for pyramus is a sweet-faced man;a proper man,as one shall see in a summer\\'s day;a most lovely,gentleman-like man;therefore,you must needs play pyramus.well,i will undertake it.what beard were i best to play it in ?why,what you will.i will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,your orange-tawny beard,your purple-in-grain beard,or your french-crown colour beard,your perfect yellow.some of your french crowns have no hair at all,and then you will play bare-faced.but masters,here are your parts;and i am to entreat you,request you,and desire you,to con them by to-morrow night,and meet me in the palace wood,a mile without the town,by moonlight : there will we rehearse;for if we meet in the city,we shall be dogged with company,and our devices known.in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties,such as our play wants.i pray you,fail me not.we will meet;and there we may rehearse more obscenely and courageously.take pains;be perfect;adieu.at the duke\\'s oak we meet.enough;hold,or cut bow-strings.how now,spirit ! whither wander you ?over hill,over dale,thorough bush,thorough brier,over park,over pale,thorough flood,thorough fire,i do wander every where,swifter than the moone\\'s sphere;and i serve the fairy queen,to dew her orbs upon the green :the cowslips tall her pensioners be;in their gold coats spots you see;those be rubies,fairy favours,in their freckles live their savours :i must go seek some dew-drops here,and hang a pearl in every cowslip\\'s ear.farewell,thou lob of spirits : i\\'ll be gone;our queen and all her elves come here anon.the king doth keep his revels here to-night.take heed the queen come not within his sight;for oberon is passing fell and wrath,because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy,stol\\'n from an indian king;she never had so sweet a changeling;and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train,to trace the forests wild;but she,perforce,withholds the loved boy,crowns him with flowers,and makes him all her joy.and now they never meet in grove,or green,by fountain clear,or spangled starlight sheen,but they do square;that all their elves,for fear,creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.either i mistake your shape and making quite,or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite call\\'d robin goodfellow : are you not he that frights the maidens of the villagery;skim milk,and sometimes labour in the quern,and bootless make the breathless housewife churn;and sometime make the drink to bear no barm;mislead night-wanderers,laughing at their harm ?those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck,you do their work,and they shall have good luck :are you not he ?fairy,thou speak\\'st aright;i am that merry wanderer of the night.i jest to oberon,and make him smile when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,neighing in likeness of a filly foal :and sometime lurk i in a gossip\\'s bowl,in very likeness of a roasted crab;and,when she drinks,against her lips i bob and on her wither\\'d dewlap pour the ale.the wisest aunt,telling the saddest tale,sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;then slip i from her bum,down topples she,and \\'tailor\\' cries,and falls into a cough;and then the whole quire hold their hips and loff;and waxen in their mirth,and neeze,and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there.but,room,fairy ! here comes oberon.and here my mistress.would that he were gone !ill met by moonlight,proud titania.what ! jealous oberon.fairies,skip hence :i have forsworn his bed and company.tarry,rash wanton ! am not i thy lord ?then,i must be thy lady;but i know when thou hast stol\\'n away from fairy land,and in the shape of corin sat all day,playing on pipes of corn,and versing love to amorous phillida.why art thou here,come from the furthest steppe of india ?but that,forsooth,the bouncing amazon,your buskin\\'d mistress and your warrior love,to theseus must be wedded,and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity.how canst thou thus for shame,titania,glance at my credit with hippolyta,knowing i know thy love to theseus ?didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigouna,whom he ravished ?and make him with fair gle break his faith,with ariadne,and antiopa ?these are the forgeries of jealousy :and never,since the middle summer\\'s spring,met we on hill,in dale,forest,or mead,by paved fountain,or by rushy brook,or in the beached margent of the sea,to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,but with thy brawls thou hast disturb\\'d our sport.therefore the winds,piping to us in vain,as in revenge,have suck\\'d up from the sea contagious fogs;which,falling in the land,have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents :the ox hath therefore stretch\\'d his yoke in vain,the ploughman lost his sweat,and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain\\'d a beard :the fold stands empty in the drowned field,and crows are fatted with the murrion flock;the nine men\\'s morris is fill\\'d up with mud,and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable :the human mortals want their winter here :no night is now with hymn or carol blest :therefore the moon,the governess of floods,pale in her anger,washes all the air,that rheumatic diseases do abound :and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,and on old hiems\\' thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is,as in mockery,set.the spring,the summer,the childing autumn,angry winter,change their wonted liveries,and the mazed world,by their increase,now knows not which is which.and this same progeny of evil comes from our debate,from our dissension :we are their parents and original.do you amend it then;it lies in you.why should titania cross her oberon ?i do but beg a little changeling boy,to be my henchman.set your heart at rest;the fairy land buys not the child of me.his mother was a votaress of my order :and,in the spiced indian air,by night,full often hath she gossip\\'d by my side,and sat with me on neptune\\'s yellow sands,marking the embarked traders on the flood;when we have laugh\\'d to see the sails conceive and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;which she,with pretty and with swimming gait following,her womb then rich with my young squire,would imitate,and sail upon the land,to fetch me trifles,and return again,as from a voyage,rich with merchandise.but she,being mortal,of that boy did die;and for her sake i do rear up her boy,and for her sake i will not part with him.how long within this wood intend you stay ?perchance,till after theseus\\' weddingday.if you will patiently dance in our round,and see our moonlight revels,go with us;if not,shun me,and i will spare your haunts.give me that boy,and i will go with thee.not for thy fairy kingdom.fairies,away !we shall chide downright,if i longer stay.well,go thy way : thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury.my gentle puck,come hither.thou remember\\'st since once i sat upon a promontory,and heard a mermaid on a dolphin\\'s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,that the rude sea grew civil at her song,and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea-maid\\'s music.i remember.that very time i saw,but thou couldst not,flying between the cold moon and the earth,cupid all arm\\'d : a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west,and loos\\'d his love-shaft smartly from his bow,as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;but i might see young cupid\\'s fiery shaft quench\\'d in the chaste beams of the wat\\'ry moon,and the imperial votaress passed on,in maiden meditation,fancy-free.yet mark\\'d i where the bolt of cupid fell :it fell upon a little western flower,before milk-white,now purple with love\\'s wound,and maidens call it,love-in-idleness.fetch me that flower;the herb i show\\'d thee once :the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.fetch me this herb;and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league.i\\'ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes.having once this juice i\\'ll watch titania when she is asleep,and drop the liquor of it in her eyes :the next thing then she waking looks upon,be it on lion,bear,or wolf,or bull,on meddling monkey,or on busy ape,she shall pursue it with the soul of love :and ere i take this charm off from her sight,as i can take it with another herb,i\\'ll make her render up her page to me.but who comes here ? i am invisible,and i will overhear their conference.i love thee not,therefore pursue me not.where is lysander and fair hermia ?the one i\\'ll slay,the other slayeth me.thou told\\'st me they were stol\\'n into this wood;and here am i,and wood within this wood,because i cannot meet my hermia.hence ! get thee gone,and follow me no more.you draw me,you hard-hearted adamant :but yet you draw not iron,for my heart is true as steel : leave you your power to draw,and i shall have no power to follow you.do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ?or,rather,do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you ?and even for that do i love you the more.i am your spaniel;and,demetrius,the more you beat me,i will fawn on you :use me but as your spaniel,spurn me,strike me,neglect me,lose me;only give me leave,unworthy as i am,to follow you.what worser place can i beg in your love,and yet a place of high respect with me,than to be used as you use your dog ?tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,for i am sick when i do look on you.and i am sick when i look not on you.you do impeach your modesty too much,to leave the city,and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not;to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity.your virtue is my privilege : for that it is not night when i do see your face,therefore i think i am not in the night;nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,for you in my respect are all the world :then how can it be said i am alone,when all the world is here to look on me ?i\\'ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.the wildest hath not such a heart as you.run when you will,the story shall be chang\\'d;apollo flies,and daphne holds the chase;the dove pursues the griffin;the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger : bootless speed,when cowardice pursues and valour flies.i will not stay thy questions : let me go;or,if thou follow me,do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood.ay,in the temple,in the town,the field,you do me mischief.fie,demetrius !your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.we cannot fight for love,as men may do;we should be woo\\'d and were not made to woo.i\\'ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,to die upon the hand i love so well.fare thee well,nymph : ere he do leave this grove,thou shalt fly him,and he shall seek thy love.hast thou the flower there ? welcome,wanderer.ay,there it is.i pray thee,give it me.i know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows,where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,with sweet musk-roses,and with eglantine :there sleeps titania some time of the night,lull\\'d in these flowers with dances and delight;and there the snake throws her enamell\\'d skin,weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in :and with the juice of this i\\'ll streak her eyes,and make her full of hateful fantasies.take thou some of it,and seek through this grove :a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth : anoint his eyes;but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady.thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on.effect it with some care,that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love.and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.fear not,my lord,your servant shall do so.come,now a roundel and a fairy song;then,for the third of a minute,hence;some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,to make my small elves coats,and some keep back the clamorous owl,that nightly hoots,and wonders at our quaint spirits.sing me now asleep;then to your offices,and let me rest.the fairies sing.i.you spotted snakes with double tongue,thorny hedge-hogs,be not seen;newts,and blind-worms,do no wrong;come not near our fairy queen.philomel,with melody,sing in our sweet lullaby :lulla,lulla,lullaby;lulla,lulla,lullaby :never harm,nor spell,nor charm,come our lovely lady nigh;so,good night,with lullaby.ii.weaving spiders come not here;hence,you long-legg\\'d spinners,hence !beetles black,approach not near;worm nor snail,do no offence.philomel,with melody,&c.hence,away ! now all is well.one aloof stand sentinel.what thou seest when thou dost wake,do it for thy true-love take;love and languish for his sake :be it ounce,or cat,or bear,pard,or boar with bristled hair,in thy eye that shall appear when thou wak\\'st,it is thy dear.wake when some vile thing is near.fair love,you faint with wandering in the wood;and to speak troth,i have forgot our way :we\\'ll rest us,hermia,if you think it good,and tarry for the comfort of the day.be it so,lysander : find you out a bed,for i upon this bank will rest my head.one turf shall serve as pillow for us both;one heart,one bed,two bosoms,and one troth.nay,good lysander;for my sake,my dear,lie further off yet,do not lie so near.o ! take the sense,sweet,of my innocence,love takes the meaning in love\\'s conference.i mean that my heart unto yours is knit,so that but one heart we can make of it;two bosoms interchained with an oath;so then two bosoms and a single troth.then by your side no bed-room me deny,for,lying so,hermia,i do not lie.lysander riddles very prettily :now much beshrew my manners and my pride,if hermia meant to say lysander lied.but,gentle friend,for love and courtesy lie further off;in human modesty,such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,so far be distant;and,good night,sweet friend.thy love ne\\'er alter till thy sweet life end !amen,amen,to that fair prayer,say i;and then end life when i end loyalty !here is my bed : sleep give thee all his rest !with half that wish the wisher\\'s eyes be press\\'d !through the forest have i gone,but athenian found i none,on whose eyes i might approve this flower\\'s force in stirring love.night and silence ! who is here ?weeds of athens he doth wear :this is he,my master said,despised the athenian maid;and here the maiden,sleeping sound,on the dank and dirty ground.pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love,this kill-courtesy.churl,upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe.when thou wak\\'st,let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid :so awake when i am gone;for i must now to oberon.stay,though thou kill me,sweet demetrius.i charge thee,hence,and do not haunt me thus.o ! wilt thou darkling leave me ? do not so.stay,on thy peril : i alone will go.o ! i am out of breath in this fond chase.the more my prayer,the lesser is my grace.happy is hermia,wheresoe\\'er she lies;for she hath blessed and attractive eyes.how came her eyes so bright ? not with salt tears :if so,my eyes are oftener wash\\'d than hers.no,no,i am as ugly as a bear;for beasts that meet me run away for fear;therefore no marvel though demetrius do,as a monster,fly my presence thus.what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia\\'s sphery eyne ?but who is here ? lysander ! on the ground !dead ? or asleep ? i see no blood,no wound.lysander,if you live,good sir,awake.and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake.transparent helena ! nature shows art,that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.where is demetrius ? o ! how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword.do not say so,lysander;say not so.what though he love your hermia ? lord ! what though ?yet hermia still loves you : then be content.content with hermia ! no : i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent.not hermia,but helena i love :who will not change a raven for a dove ?the will of man is by his reason sway\\'d,and reason says you are the worthier maid.things growing are not ripe until their season;so i,being young,till now ripe not to reason;and touching now the point of human skill,reason becomes the marshal to my will,and leads me to your eyes;where i o\\'erlook love\\'s stories written in love\\'s richest book.wherefore was i to this keen mockery born ?when at your hands did i deserve this scorn ?is\\'t not enough,is\\'t not enough,young man,that i did never,no,nor never can,deserve a sweet look from demetrius\\' eye,but you must flout my insufficiency ?good troth,you do me wrong,good sooth,you do,in such disdainful manner me to woo.but fare you well : perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness.o ! that a lady of one man refus\\'d,should of another therefore be abus\\'d.she sees not hermia.hermia,sleep thou there;and never mayst thou come lysander near.for,as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings;or,as the heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive :so thou,my surfeit and my heresy,of all be hated,but the most of me !and,all my powers,address your love and might to honour helen,and to be her knight.help me,lysander,help me ! do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.ay me,for pity ! what a dream was here !lysander,look how i do quake with fear :methought a serpent eat my heart away,and you sat smiling at his cruel prey.lysander ! what ! remov\\'d ?lysander ! lord !what ! out of hearing ? gone ? no sound,no word ?alack ! where are you ? speak,an if you hear;speak,of all loves ! i swound almost with fear.no ! then i well perceive you are not nigh :either death or you i\\'ll find immediately.are we all met ?pat,pat;and here\\'s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.this green plot shall be our stage,this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house;and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.peter quince,what sayst thou,bully bottom ?there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisby that will never please.first,pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself,which the ladies cannot abide.how answer you that ?by\\'r lakin,a parlous fear.i believe we must leave the killing out,when all is done.not a whit : i have a device to make all well.write me a prologue;and let the prologue seem to say,we will do no harm with our swords,and that pyramus is not killed indeed;and,for the more better assurance,tell them that i,pyramus,am not pyramus,but bottom the weaver : this will put them out of fear.well,we will have such a prologue,and it shall be written in eight and six.no,make it two more : let it be written in eight and eight.will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?i fear it,i promise you.masters,you ought to consider with yourselves : to bring in,god shield us !a lion among ladies,is a most dreadful thing;for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living,and we ought to look to it.therefore,another prologue must tell he is not a lion.nay,you must name his name,and half his face must be seen through the lion\\'s neck;and he himself must speak through,saying thus,or to the same defect,\\'ladies,\\' or,\\'fair ladies,\\' \\'i would wish you,\\' or,\\'i would request you,\\' or,\\'i would entreat you,not to fear,not to tremble : my life for yours.if you think i come hither as a lion,it were pity of my life : no,i am no such thing : i am a man as other men are;\\' and there indeed let him name his name,and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner.well,it shall be so.but there is two hard things,that is,to bring the moonlight into a chamber;for,you know,pyramus and thisby meet by moonlight.doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?a calendar,a calendar ! look in the almanack;find out moonshine,find out moonshine.yes,it doth shine that night.why,then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window,where we play,open;and the moon may shine in at the casement.ay;or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn,and say he comes to disfigure,or to present,the person of moonshine.then,there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber;for pyramus and thisby,says the story,did talk through the chink of a wall.you can never bring in a wall.what say you,bottom ?some man or other must present wall;and let him have some plaster,or some loam,or some rough-cast about him,to signify wall;and let him hold his fingers thus,and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisby whisper.if that may be,than all is well.come,sit down,every mother\\'s son,and rehearse your parts.pyramus,you begin : when you have spoken your speech,enter into that brake;and so every one according to his cue.what hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?what ! a play toward;i\\'ll be an auditor;an actor too perhaps,if i see cause.speak,pyramus.thisby,stand forth.thisby,the flowers have odious savours sweet,odorous,odorous.odours savours sweet :so hath thy breath,my dearest thisby dear.but hark,a voice ! stay thou but here awhile,and by and by i will to thee appear.a stranger pyramus than e\\'er play\\'d here !must i speak now ?ay,marry,must you;for you must understand,he goes but to see a noise that he heard,and is to come again.most radiant pyramus,most lily-white of hue,of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,most brisky juvenal,and eke most lovely jew,as true as truest horse that yet would never tire,i\\'ll meet thee,pyramus,at ninny\\'s tomb.\\'ninus\\' tomb,\\' man.why,you must not speak that yet;that you answer to pyramus : you speak all your part at once,cues and all.pyramus,enter : your cue is past;it is \\'never tire.\\' o !as true as truest horse,that yet would never tire.if i were,fair thisby,i were only thine.o monstrous ! o strange ! we are haunted.pray,masters ! fly,masters !help !i\\'ll follow you,i\\'ll lead you about a round,through bog,through bush,through brake,through brier :sometime a horse i\\'ll be,sometime a hound,a hog,a headless bear,sometime a fire;and neigh,and bark,and grunt,and roar,and burn,like horse,hound,hog,bear,fire,at every turn.why do they run away ? this is a knavery of them to make me afeard.o bottom,thou art changed ! what do i see on thee ?what do you see ? you see an ass-head of your own,do you ?bless thee,bottom ! bless thee ! thou art translated.i see their knavery : this is to make an ass of me;to fright me,if they could.but i will not stir from this place,do what they can : i will walk up and down here,and i will sing,that they shall hear i am not afraid.the ousel-cock,so black of hue,with orange-tawny bill,the throstle with his note so true,the wren with little quill.what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ?the finch,the sparrow,and the lark,the plain-song cuckoo gray,whose note full many a man doth mark,and dares not answer,nay;for indeed,who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ? who would give a bird the lie,though he cry \\'cuckoo\\' never so ?i pray thee,gentle mortal,sing again :mine ear is much enamour\\'d of thy note;so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;and thy fair virtue\\'s force,perforce,doth move me,on the first view,to say,to swear,i love thee.methinks,mistress,you should have little reason for that : and yet,to say the truth,reason and love keep little company together now-a-days.the more the pity,that some honest neighbours will not make them friends.nay,i can gleek upon occasion.thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.not so,neither;but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood,i have enough to serve mine own turn.out of this wood do not desire to go :thou shalt remain here,whe\\'r thou wilt or no.i am a spirit of no common rate;the summer still doth tend upon my state;and i do love thee : therefore,go with me;i\\'ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,and sing,while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep :and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.pease-blossom ! cobweb ! moth ! and mustardseed !ready.and i.and i.and i.where shall we go ?be kind and courteous to this gentleman;hop in his walks,and gambol in his eyes;feed him with apricocks and dewberries,with purple grapes,green figs,and mulberries.the honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,and for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,and light them at the fiery glow-worm\\'s eyes,to have my love to bed,and to arise;and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes :nod to him,elves,and do him courtesies.hail,mortal !hail !hail !hail !i cry your worships mercy,heartily : i beseech your worship\\'s name.cobweb.i shall desire you of more acquaintance,good master cobweb : if i out my finger,i shall make bold with you.your name,honest gentleman ?pease-blossom.i pray you,commend me to mistress squash,your mother,and to master peascod,your father.good master pease-blossom,i shall desire you of more acquaintance too.your name,i beseech you,sir ?mustard-seed.good master mustard-seed,i know your patience well : that same cowardly,giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house.i promise you,your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now.i desire you of more acquaintance,good master mustard-seed.come,wait upon him;lead him to my bower.the moon methinks,looks with a watery eye;and when she weeps,weeps every little flower,lamenting some enforced chastity.tie up my love\\'s tongue,bring him silently.i wonder if titania be awak\\'d;then,what it was that next came in her eye,which she must dote on in extremity.here comes my messenger.how now,mad spirit !what night-rule now about this haunted grove ?my mistress with a monster is in love.near to her close and consecrated bower,while she was in her dull and sleeping hour,a crew of patches,rude mechanicals,that work for bread upon athenian stalls,were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus\\' nuptial day.the shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene,and enter\\'d in a brake,when i did him at this advantage take;an ass\\'s nowl i fixed on his head :anon his thisbe must be answered,and forth my mimick comes.when they him spy,as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,or russet-pated choughs,many in sort,rising and cawing at the gun\\'s report,sever themselves,and madly sweep the sky;so,at his sight,away his fellows fly,and,at our stamp,here o\\'er and o\\'er one falls;he murder cries,and help from athens calls.their sense thus weak,lost with their fears thus strong,made senseless things begin to do them wrong;for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;some sleeves,some hats,from yielders all things catch.i led them on in this distracted fear,and left sweet pyramus translated there;when in that moment,so it came to pass,titania wak\\'d and straightway lov\\'d an ass.this falls out better than i could devise.but hast thou yet latch\\'d the athenian\\'s eyes with the love-juice,as i did bid thee do ?i took him sleeping,that is finish\\'d too,and the athenian woman by his side;that,when he wak\\'d,of force she must be ey\\'d.stand close : this is the same athenian.this is the woman;but not this the man.o ! why rebuke you him that loves you so ?lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.now i but chide;but i should use thee worse,for thou,i fear,hast given me cause to curse.if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep,being o\\'er shoes in blood,plunge in knee deep,and kill me too.the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me.would he have stol\\'n away from sleeping hermia ? i\\'ll believe as soon this whole earth may be bor\\'d,and that the moon may through the centre creep,and so displease her brother\\'s noontide with the antipodes.it cannot be but thou hast murder\\'d him;so should a murderer look,so dead,so grim.so should the murder\\'d look,and so should i,pierc\\'d through the heart with your stern cruelty;yet you,the murderer,look as bright,as clear,as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere.what\\'s this to my lysander ? where is he ?ah ! good demetrius,wilt thou give him me ?i had rather give his carcass to my hounds.out,dog ! out,cur ! thou driv\\'st me past the bounds of maiden\\'s patience.hast thou slain him then ?henceforth be never number\\'d among men !o ! once tell true,tell true,e\\'en for my sake;durst thou have look\\'d upon him being awake,and hast thou kill\\'d him sleeping ? o brave touch !could not a worm,an adder,do so much ?an adder did it;for with doubler tongue than thine,thou serpent,never adder stung.you spend your passion on a mispris\\'d mood :i am not guilty of lysander\\'s blood,nor is he dead,for aught that i can tell.i pray thee,tell me then that he is well.an if i could,what should i get therefore ?a privilege never to see me more.and from thy hated presence part i so;see me no more,whe\\'r he be dead or no.there is no following her in this fierce vein :here therefore for awhile i will remain.so sorrow\\'s heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;which now in some slight measure it will pay,if for his tender here i make some stay.what hast thou done ? thou hast mistaken quite,and laid the love-juice on some true-love\\'s sight :of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true-love turn\\'d,and not a false turn\\'d true.then fate o\\'er-rules,that,one man holding troth,a million fail,confounding oath on oath.about the wood go swifter than the wind,and helena of athens look thou find :all fancy-sick she is,and pale of cheer with sighs of love,that cost the fresh blood dear.by some illusion see thou bring her here :i\\'ll charm his eyes against she do appear.i go,i go;look how i go;swifter than arrow from the tartar\\'s bow.flower of this purple dye,hit with cupid\\'s archery,sink in apple of his eye.when his love he doth espy,let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky.when thou wak\\'st,if she be by,beg of her for remedy.captain of our fairy band,helena is here at hand,and the youth,mistook by me,pleading for a lover\\'s fee.shall we their fond pageant see ?lord,what fools these mortals be !stand aside : the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake.then will two at once woo one;that must needs be sport alone;and those things do best please me that befall preposterously.why should you think that i should woo in scorn ?scorn and derision never come in tears :look,when i vow,i weep;and vows so born,in their nativity all truth appears.how can these things in me seem scorn to you,bearing the badge of faith to prove them true ?you do advance your cunning more and more.when truth kills truth,o devilish-holy fray !these vows are hermia\\'s : will you give her o\\'er ?weigh oath with oath,and you will nothing weigh :your vows,to her and me,put in two scales,will even weigh,and both as light as tales.i had no judgment when to her i swore.nor none,in my mind,now you give her o\\'er.demetrius loves her,and he loves not you.o helen ! goddess,nymph,perfect,divine !to what,my love,shall i compare thine eyne ?crystal is muddy.o ! how ripe in show thy lips,those kissing cherries,tempting grow,this pure congealed white,high taurus\\' snow,fann\\'d with the eastern wind,turns to a crow when thou hold\\'st up thy hand.o ! let me kiss that princess of pure white,this seal of bliss.o spite ! o hell ! i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment :if you were civil and knew courtesy,you would not do me thus much injury.can you not hate me,as i know you do,but you must join in souls to mock me too ?if you were men,as men you are in show,you would not use a gentle lady so;to vow,and swear,and superpraise my parts,when i am sure you hate me with your hearts.you both are rivals,and love hermia,and now both rivals,to mock helena :a trim exploit,a manly enterprise,to conjure tears up in a poor maid\\'s eyes with your derision ! none of noble sort would so offend a virgin,and extort a poor soul\\'s patience,all to make you sport.you are unkind,demetrius;be not so;for you love hermia;this you know i know :and here,with all good will,with all my heart,in hermia\\'s love i yield you up my part;and yours of helena to me bequeath,whom i do love,and will do to my death.never did mockers waste more idle breath.lysander,keep thy hermia;i will none :if e\\'er i lov\\'d her,all that love is gone.my heart with her but as guest wise sojourn\\'d,and now to helen it is home return\\'d,there to remain.helen,it is not so.disparage not the faith thou dost not know,lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.look ! where thy love comes : yonder is thy dear.dark night,that from the eye his function takes,the ear more quick of apprehension makes;wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,it pays the hearing double recompense.thou art not by mine eye,lysander,found;mine ear,i thank it,brought me to thy sound.but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?why should he stay,whom love doth press to go ?what love could press lysander from my side ?lysander\\'s love,that would not let him bide,fair helena,who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.why seek\\'st thou me ? could not this make thee know,the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so ?you speak not as you think : it cannot be.lo ! she is one of this confederacy.now i perceive they have conjoin\\'d all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me.injurious hermia ! most ungrateful maid !have you conspir\\'d,have you with these contriv\\'d to bait me with this foul derision ?is all the counsel that we two have shar\\'d,the sister-vows,the hours that we have spent,when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us,o ! is it all forgot ?all school-days\\' friendship,childhood innocence ?we,hermia,like two artificial gods,have with our neelds created both one flower,both on one sampler,sitting on one cushion,both warbling of one song,both in one key,as if our hands,our sides,voices,and minds,had been incorporate.so we grew together,like to a double cherry,seeming parted,but yet an union in partition;two lovely berries moulded on one stem;so,with two seeming bodies,but one heart;two of the first,like coats in heraldry,due but to one,and crowned with one crest.and will you rent our ancient love asunder,to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?it is not friendly,\\'tis not maidenly :our sex,as well as i,may chide you for it,though i alone do feel the injury.i am amazed at your passionate words.i scorn you not : it seems that you scorn me.have you not set lysander,as in scorn,to follow me and praise my eyes and face,and made your other love,demetrius,who even but now did spurn me with his foot,to call me goddess,nymph,divine and rare,precious,celestial ? wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ? and wherefore doth lysander deny your love,so rich within his soul,and tender me,forsooth,affection,but by your setting on,by your consent ?what though i be not so in grace as you,so hung upon with love,so fortunate,but miserable most to love unlov\\'d ?this you should pity rather than despise.i understand not what you mean by this.ay,do,persever,counterfeit sad looks,make mouths upon me when i turn my back;wink each at other;hold the sweet jest up :this sport,well carried,shall be chronicled.if you have any pity,grace,or manners,you would not make me such an argument.but,fare ye well : \\'tis partly mine own fault,which death or absence soon shall remedy.stay,gentle helena ! hear my excuse :my love,my life,my soul,fair helena !o excellent !sweet,do not scorn her so.if she cannot entreat,i can compel.thou canst compel no more than she entreat :thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.helen,i love thee;by my life,i do :i swear by that which i will lose for thee,to prove him false that says i love thee not.i say i love thee more than he can do.if thou say so,withdraw,and prove it too.quick,come !lysander,whereto tends all this ?away,you ethiop !no,no,he\\'ll...seem to break loose;take on,as you would follow,but yet come not : you are a tame man,go !hang off,thou cat,thou burr ! vile thing,let loose,or i will shake thee from me like a serpent.why are you grown so rude ? what change is this,sweet love,thy love ! out,tawny tartar,out !out,loathed medicine ! hated poison,hence !do you not jest ?yes,sooth;and so do you.demetrius,i will keep my word with thee.i would i had your bond,for i perceive a weak bond holds you : i\\'ll not trust your word.what ! should i hurt her,strike her,kill her dead ?although i hate her,i\\'ll not harm her so.what ! can you do me greater harm than hate ?hate me ! wherefore ? o me ! what news,my love ?am not i hermia ? are not you lysander ?i am as fair now as i was erewhile.since night you lov\\'d me;yet,since night you left me :why,then you left me,o,the gods forbid !in earnest,shall i say ?ay,by my life;and never did desire to see thee more.therefore be out of hope,of question,doubt;be certain,nothing truer : \\'tis no jest,that i do hate thee and love helena.o me ! you juggler ! you canker-blossom !you thief of love ! what ! have you come by night and stol\\'n my love\\'s heart from him ?fine,i\\' faith !have you no modesty,no maiden shame,no touch of bashfulness ? what ! will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue ?fie,fie ! you counterfeit,you puppet you !puppet ! why,so : ay,that way goes the game.now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures : she hath urg\\'d her height;and with her personage,her tall personage,her height,forsooth,she hath prevail\\'d with him.and are you grown so high in his esteem,because i am so dwarfish and so low ?how low am i,thou painted maypole ? speak;how low am i ? i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.i pray you,though you mock me,gentlemen,let her not hurt me : i was never curst;i have no gift at all in shrewishness;i am a right maid for my cowardice :let her not strike me.you perhaps may think,because she is something lower than myself,that i can match her.lower ! hark,again.good hermia,do not be so bitter with me.i evermore did love you,hermia,did ever keep your counsels,never wrong\\'d you;save that,in love unto demetrius,i told him of your stealth unto this wood.he follow\\'d you;for love i follow\\'d him;but he hath chid me hence,and threaten\\'d me to strike me,spurn me,nay,to kill me too :and now,so you will let me quiet go,to athens will i bear my folly back,and follow you no further : let me go :you see how simple and how fond i am.why,get you gone.who is\\'t that hinders you ?a foolish heart,that i leave here behind.what ! with lysander ?with demetrius.be not afraid : she shall not harm thee,helena.no,sir;she shall not,though you take her part.o ! when she\\'s angry,she is keen and shrewd.she was a vixen when she went to school :and though she be but little,she is fierce.\\'little\\' again ! nothing but \\'low\\' and \\'little !\\' why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?let me come to her.get you gone,you dwarf;you minimus,of hindering knot-grass made;you bead,you acorn !you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services.let her alone;speak not of helena;take not her part,for,if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her,thou shalt aby it.now she holds me not;now follow,if thou dar\\'st,to try whose right,or thine or mine,is most in helena.follow ! nay,i\\'ll go with thee,cheek by jole.you,mistress,all this coil is \\'long of you :nay,go not back.i will not trust you,i,nor longer stay in your curst company.your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,my legs are longer though,to run away.i am amaz\\'d,and know not what to say.this is thy negligence : still thou mistak\\'st,or else commit\\'st thy knaveries wilfully.believe me,king of shadows,i mistook.did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ?and so far blameless proves my enterprise,that i have \\'nointed an athenian\\'s eyes;and so far am i glad it so did sort,as this their jangling i esteem a sport.thou see\\'st these lovers seek a place to fight :hie therefore,robin,overcast the night;the starry welking cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron;and lead these testy rivals so astray,as one come not within another\\'s way.like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue,then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong;and sometime rail thou like demetrius;and from each other look thou lead them thus,till o\\'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep :then crush this herb into lysander\\'s eye;whose liquor hath this virtuous property,to take from thence all error with his might,and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.when they next wake,all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;and back to athens shall the lovers wend,with league whose date till death shall never end.whiles i in this affair do thee employ,i\\'ll to my queen and beg her indian boy;and then i will her charmed eye release from monster\\'s view,and all things shall be peace.my fairy lord,this must be done with haste,for night\\'s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,and yonder shines aurora\\'s harbinger;at whose approach,ghosts,wandering here and there,troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all,that in cross-ways and floods have burial,already to their wormy beds are gone;for fear lest day should look their shames upon,they wilfully themselves exile from light,and must for aye consort with black-brow\\'d night.but we are spirits of another sort.i with the morning\\'s love have oft made sport;and,like a forester,the groves may tread,even till the eastern gate,all fiery-red,opening on neptune with fair blessed beams,turns into yellow gold his salt green-streams.but,notwithstanding,haste;make no delay :we may effect this business yet ere day.up and down,up and down;i will lead them up and down :i am fear\\'d in field and town;goblin,lead them up and down.here comes one.where art thou,proud demetrius ? speak thou now.here,villain ! drawn and ready.where art thou ?i will be with thee straight.follow me,then,to plainer ground.lysander ! speak again.thou runaway,thou coward,art thou fled ?speak ! in some bush ? where dost thou hide thy head ?thou coward ! art thou bragging to the stars,telling the bushes that thou look\\'st for wars,and wilt not come ? come,recreant;come,thou child;i\\'ll whip thee with a rod : he is defil\\'d that draws a sword on thee.yea,art thou there ?follow my voice : we\\'ll try no manhood here.he goes before me and still dares me on :when i come where he calls,then he is gone.the villain is much lighter-heel\\'d than i :i follow\\'d fast,but faster he did fly;that fallen am i in dark uneven way,and here will rest me.come,thou gentle day !for if but once thou show me thy grey light,i\\'ll find demetrius and revenge this spite.ho ! ho ! ho ! coward,why com\\'st thou not ?abide me,if thou dar\\'st;for well i wot thou runn\\'st before me,shifting every place,and dar\\'st not stand,nor look me in the face.where art thou now ?come hither : i am here.nay then,thou mock\\'st me.thou shalt buy this dear,if ever i thy face by daylight see :now,go thy way.faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed :by day\\'s approach look to be visited.o weary night ! o long and tedious night,abate thy hours ! shine,comforts,from the east !that i may back to athens by daylight,from these that my poor company detest :and sleep,that sometimes shuts up sorrow\\'s eye,steal me awhile from mine own company.yet but three ? come one more;two of both kinds make up four.here she comes,curst and sad :cupid is a knavish lad,thus to make poor females mad.never so weary,never so in woe,bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,i can no further crawl,no further go;my legs can keep no pace with my desires.here will i rest me till the break of day.heavens shield lysander,if they mean a fray !on the ground sleep sound :i\\'ll apply to your eye,gentle lover,remedy when thou wak\\'st,thou tak\\'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady\\'s eye :and the country proverb known,that every man should take his own,in your waking shall be shown :jack shall have jill;nought shall go ill;the man shall have his mare again,and all shall be well.come,sit thee down upon this flowery bed,while i thy amiable cheeks do coy,and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,and kiss thy fair large ears,my gentle joy.where\\'s pease-blossom ?ready.scratch my head,pease-blossom.where\\'s mounsieur cobweb ?ready.mounsieur cobweb,good mounsieur,get your weapons in your hand,and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle;and,good mounsieur,bring me the honey-bag.do not fret yourself too much in the action,mounsieur;and,good mounsieur,have a care the honey-bag break not;i would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag,signior.where\\'s mounsieur mustard-seed ?ready.give me your neaf,mounsieur mustard-seed.pray you,leave your curtsy,good mounsieur.what\\'s your will ?nothing,good mounsieur,but to help cavalery cobweb to scratch.i must to the barber\\'s,mounsieur,for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the face;and i am such a tender ass,if my hair do but tickle me,i must scratch.what,wilt thou hear some music,my sweet love ?i have a reasonable good ear in music : let us have the tongs and the bones.or say,sweet love,what thou desir\\'st to eat.truly,a peck of provender : i could munch your good dry oats.methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay : good hay,sweet hay,hath no fellow.i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel\\'s hoard,and fetch thee thence new nuts.i had rather have a handful or two of dried pease.but,i pray you,let none of your people stir me : i have an exposition of sleep come upon me.sleep thou,and i will wind thee in my arms.fairies,be gone,and be all ways away.so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist;the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm.o ! how i love thee;how i dote on thee !welcome,good robin.see\\'st thou this sweet sight ?her dotage now i do begin to pity :for,meeting her of late behind the wood,seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,i did upbraid her and fall out with her;for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;and that same dew,which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,stood now within the pretty flowerets\\' eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.when i had at my pleasure taunted her,and she in mild terms begg\\'d my patience,i then did ask of her her changeling child;which straight she gave me,and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land.and now i have the boy,i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes :and,gentle puck,take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain,that he,awaking when the other do,may all to athens back again repair,and think no more of this night\\'s accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream.but first i will release the fairy queen.be as thou wast wont to be;see as thou wast wont to see :dian\\'s bud o\\'er cupid\\'s flower hath such force and blessed power.now,my titania;wake you,my sweet queen.my oberon ! what visions have i seen !methought i was enamour\\'d of an ass.there lies your love.how came these things to pass ?o ! how mine eyes do loathe his visage now.silence,awhile.robin,take off this head.titania,music call;and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense.music,ho ! music ! such as charmeth sleep.when thou wak\\'st,with thine own fool\\'s eyes peep.sound,music !come,my queen,take hands with me,and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.now thou and i are new in amity,and will to-morrow midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus\\' house triumphantly,and bless it to all fair prosperity.there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded,with theseus,all in jollity.fairy king,attend,and mark :i do hear the morning lark.then,my queen,in silence sad,trip we after the night\\'s shade;we the globe can compass soon,swifter than the wandering moon.come,my lord;and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground.go,one of you,find out the forester;for now our observation is perform\\'d;and since we have the vaward of the day,my love shall hear the music of my hounds.uncouple in the western valley;let them go :dispatch,i say,and find the forester.we will,fair queen,up to the mountain\\'s top,and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction.i was with hercules and cadmus once,when in a wood of crete they bay\\'d the bear with hounds of sparta : never did i hear such gallant chiding;for,besides the groves,the skies,the fountains,every region near seem\\'d all one mutual cry.i never heard so musical a discord,such sweet thunder.my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind,so flew\\'d,so sanded;and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew;crook-knee\\'d,and dew-lapp\\'d like thessalian bulls;slow in pursuit,but match\\'d in mouth like bells,each under each.a cry more tuneable was never holla\\'d to,nor cheer\\'d with horn,in crete,in sparta,nor in thessaly :judge,when you hear.but,soft ! what nymphs are these ?my lord,this is my daughter here asleep;and this,lysander;this demetrius is;this helena,old nedar\\'s helena :i wonder of their being here together.no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may,and,hearing our intent,came here in grace of our solemnity.but speak,egeus,is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice ?it is,my lord.go,bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.good morrow,friends.saint valentine is past :begin these wood-birds but to couple now ?pardon,my lord.i pray you all,stand up.i know you two are rival enemies :how comes this gentle concord in the world,that hatred is so far from jealousy,to sleep by hate,and fear no enmity ?my lord,i shall reply amazedly,half sleep,half waking : but as yet,i swear,i cannot truly say how i came here;but,as i think,for truly would i speak,and now i do bethink me,so it is,i came with hermia hither : our intent was to be gone from athens,where we might,without the peril of the athenian law enough,enough,my lord;you have enough :i beg the law,the law,upon his head.they would have stol\\'n away;they would,demetrius,thereby to have defeated you and me;you of your wife,and me of my consent,of my consent that she should be your wife.my lord,fair helen told me of their stealth,of this their purpose hither,to this wood;and i in fury hither follow\\'d them,fair helena in fancy following me.but,my good lord,i wot not by what power,but by some power it is,my love to hermia,melted as doth the snow,seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon;and all the faith,the virtue of my heart,the object and the pleasure of mine eye,is only helena.to her,my lord,was i betroth\\'d ere i saw hermia :but,like in sickness,did i loathe this food;but,as in health,come to my natural taste,now do i wish it,love it,long for it,and will for evermore be true to it.fair lovers,you are fortunately met :of this discourse we more will hear anon.egeus,i will overbear your will,for in the temple,by and by,with us,these couples shall eternally be knit :and,for the morning now is something worn,our purpos\\'d hunting shall be set aside.away with us,to athens : three and three,we\\'ll hold a feast in great solemnity.come,hippolyta.these things seem small and undistinguishable,like far-off mountains turned into clouds.methinks i see these things with parted eye,when everything seems double.so methinks :and i have found demetrius,like a jewel,mine own,and not mine own.are you sure that we are awake ? it seems to me that yet we sleep,we dream.do you not think the duke was here,and bid us follow him ?yea;and my father.and hippolyta.and he did bid us follow to the temple.why then,we are awake.let\\'s follow him;and by the way let us recount our dreams.when my cue comes,call me,and i will answer : my next is,\\'most fair pyramus.\\' heigh-ho ! peter quince ! flute,the bellows-mender ! snout,the tinker ! starveling ! god\\'s my life ! stolen hence,and left me asleep ! i have had a most rare vision.i have had a dream,past the wit of man to say what dream it was : man is but an ass,if he go about to expound this dream.methought i was there is no man can tell what.methought i was,and methought i had,but man is but a patched fool,if he will offer to say what methought i had.the eye of man hath not heard,the ear of man hath not seen,man\\'s hand is not able to taste,his tongue to conceive,nor his heart to report,what my dream was.i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream : it shall be called bottom\\'s dream,because it hath no bottom;and i will sing it in the latter end of a play,before the duke : peradventure,to make it the more gracious,i shall sing it at her death.have you sent to bottom\\'s house ? is he come home yet ?he cannot be heard of.out of doubt he is transported.if he come not,then the play is marred : it goes not forward,doth it ?it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he.no;he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens.yea,and the best person too;and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.you must say,\\'paragon :\\' a paramour is,god bless us ! a thing of naught.masters,the duke is coming from the temple,and there is two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward,we had all been made men.o sweet bully bottom ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life;he could not have \\'scaped sixpence a day : an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus,i\\'ll be hanged;he would have deserved it : sixpence a day in pyramus,or nothing.where are these lads ? where are these hearts ?bottom ! o most courageous day ! o most happy hour !masters,i am to discourse wonders : but ask me not what;for if i tell you,i am no true athenian.i will tell you everything,right as it fell out.let us hear,sweet bottom.not a word of me.all that i will tell you is,that the duke hath dined.get your apparel together,good strings to your beards,new ribbons to your pumps;meet presently at the palace;every man look o\\'er his part;for the short and the long is,our play is preferred.in any case,let thisby have clean linen;and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails,for they shall hang out for the lion\\'s claws.and,most dear actors,eat no onions nor garlic,for we are to utter sweet breath,and i do not doubt but to hear them say,it is a sweet comedy.no more words : away ! go;away.\\'tis strange,my theseus,that these lovers speak of.more strange than true.i never may believe these antique fables,nor these fairy toys.lovers and madmen have such seething brains,such shaping fantasies,that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends.the lunatic,the lover,and the poet,are of imagination all compact :one sees more devils than vast hell can hold,that is,the madman;the lover,all as frantic,sees helen\\'s beauty in a brow of egypt :the poet\\'s eye,in a fine frenzy rolling,doth glance from heaven to earth,from earth to heaven;and,as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown,the poet\\'s pen turns them to shapes,and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.such tricks hath strong imagination,that,if it would but apprehend some joy,it comprehends some bringer of that joy;or in the night,imagining some fear,how easy is a bush suppos\\'d a bear !but all the story of the night told over,and all their minds transfigur\\'d so together,more witnesseth than fancy\\'s images,and grows to something of great constancy,but,howsoever,strange and admirable.here come the lovers,full of joy and mirth.joy,gentle friends ! joy,and fresh days of love accompany your hearts !more than to us wait in your royal walks,your board,your bed !come now;what masques,what dances shall we have,to wear away this long age of three hours between our after-supper and bed-time ?where is our usual manager of mirth ?what revels are in hand ? is there no play,to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?call philostrate.here,mighty theseus.say,what abridgment have you for this evening ?what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile the lazy time,if not with some delight ?there is a brief how many sports are ripe;make choice of which your highness will see first.the battle with the centaurs,to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp.we\\'ll none of that : that have i told my love,in glory of my kinsman hercules.the riot of the tipsy bacchanals,tearing the thracian singer in their rage.that is an old device;and it was play\\'d when i from thebes came last a conqueror.the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning,late deceas\\'d in beggary.that is some satire keen and critical,not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe;very tragical mirth.merry and tragical ! tedious and brief !that is,hot ice and wonderous strange snow.how shall we find the concord of this discord ?a play there is,my lord,some ten words long,which is as brief as i have known a play;but by ten words,my lord,it is too long,which makes it tedious;for in all the play there is not one word apt,one player fitted.and tragical,my noble lord,it is;for pyramus therein doth kill himself.which when i saw rehears\\'d,i must confess,made mine eyes water;but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed.what are they that do play it ?hard-handed men,that work in athens here,which never labour\\'d in their minds till now,and now have toil\\'d their unbreath\\'d memories with this same play,against your nuptial.and we will hear it.no,my noble lord;it is not for you : i have heard it over,and it is nothing,nothing in the world;unless you can find sport in their intents,extremely stretch\\'d and conn\\'d with cruel pain,to do you service.i will hear that play;for never anything can be amiss,when simpleness and duty tender it.go,bring them in : and take your places,ladies.i love not to see wretchedness o\\'ercharg\\'d,and duty in his service perishing.why,gentle sweet,you shall see no such thing.he says they can do nothing in this kind.the kinder we,to give them thanks for nothing.our sport shall be to take what they mistake :and what poor duty cannot do,noble respect takes it in might,not merit.where i have come,great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes;where i have seen them shiver and look pale,make periods in the midst of sentences,throttle their practis\\'d accent in their fears,and,in conclusion,dumbly have broke off,not paying me a welcome.trust me,sweet,out of this silence yet i pick\\'d a welcome;and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence.love,therefore,and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most,to my capacity.so please your grace,the prologue is address\\'d.let him approach.if we offend,it is with our good will.that you should think,we come not to offend,but with good will.to show our simple skill,that is the true beginning of our end.consider then we come but in despite.we do not come as minding to content you,our true intent is.all for your delight,we are not here.that you should here repent you,the actors are at hand;and,by their show,you shall know all that you are like to know.this fellow doth not stand upon points.he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt;he knows not the stop.a good moral,my lord : it is not enough to speak,but to speak true.indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder;a sound,but not in government.his speech was like a tangled chain;nothing impaired,but all disordered.who is next ?gentles,perchance you wonder at this show;but wonder on,till truth make all things plain.this man is pyramus,if you would know;this beauteous lady thisby is,certain.this man,with lime and rough-cast,doth present wall,that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;and through wall\\'s chink,poor souls,they are content to whisper,at the which let no man wonder.this man,with lanthorn,dog,and bush of thorn,presenteth moonshine;for,if you will know,by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus\\' tomb,there,there to woo.this grisly beast,which lion hight by name,the trusty thisby,coming first by night,did scare away,or rather did affright;and,as she fied,her mantle she did fall,which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.anon comes pyramus,sweet youth and tall,and finds his trusty thisby\\'s mantle slain :whereat,with blade,with bloody blameful blade,he bravely broach\\'d his boiling bloody breast;and thisby,tarrying in mulberry shade,his dagger drew,and died.for all the rest,let lion,moonshine,wall,and lovers twain,at large discourse,while here they do remain.i wonder,if the lion be to speak.no wonder,my lord : one lion may,when many asses do.wall.in this same interlude it doth befall that i,one snout by name,present a wall;and such a wall,as i would have you think,that had in it a crannied hole or chink,through which the lovers,pyramus and thisby,did whisper often very secretly.this loam,this rough-cast,and this stone doth show that i am that same wall;the truth is so;and this the cranny is,right and sinister,through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse,my lord.pyramus draws near the wall : silence !o grim-look\\'d night ! o night with hue so black !o night,which ever art when day is not !o night ! o night ! alack,alack,alack !i fear my thisby\\'s promise is forgot.and thou,o wall ! o sweet,o lovely wall !that stand\\'st between her father\\'s ground and mine;thou wall,o wall ! o sweet,and lovely wall !show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne.thanks,courteous wall : jove shield thee well for this !but what see i ? no thisby do i see.o wicked wall ! through whom i see no bliss;curs\\'d be thy stones for thus deceiving me !the wall,methinks,being sensible,should curse again.no,in truth,sir,he should not.\\'deceiving me,\\' is thisby\\'s cue : she is to enter now,and i am to spy her through the wall.you shall see,it will fall pat as i told you.yonder she comes.o wall ! full often hast thou heard my moans,for parting my fair pyramus and me :my cherry lips have often kiss\\'d thy stones,thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.i see a voice : now will i to the chink,to spy an i can hear my thisby\\'s face.thisby.my love ! thou art my love,i think.think what thou wilt,i am thy lover\\'s grace;and,like limander,am i trusty still.and i like helen,till the fates me kill.not shafalus to procrus was so true.as shafalus to procrus,i to you.o ! kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.i kiss the wall\\'s hole,not your lips at all wilt thou at ninny\\'s tomb meet me straightway ?\\'tide life,\\'tide death,i come without delay.thus have i,wall,my part discharged so;and,being done,thus wall away doth go.now is the mural down between the two neighbours.no remedy,my lord,when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard.the best in this kind are but shadows,and the worst are no worse,if imagination amend them.it must be your imagination then,and not theirs.if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,they may pass for excellent men.here come two noble beasts in,a man and a lion.you,ladies,you,whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,may now perchance both quake and tremble here,when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.then know that i,one snug the joiner,am a lion-fell,nor else no lion\\'s dam :for,if i should as lion come in strife into this place,\\'twere pity on my life.a very gentle beast,and of a good conscience.the very best at a beast,my lord,that e\\'er i saw.this lion is a very fox for his valour.true;and a goose for his discretion.not so,my lord;for his valour cannot carry his discretion,and the fox carries the goose.his discretion,i am sure,cannot carry his valour,for the goose carries not the fox.it is well : leave it to his discretion,and let us listen to the moon.this lanthorn doth the horned moon present;he should have worn the horns on his head.he is no crescent,and his horns are invisible within the circumference.this lanthorn doth the horned moon present;myself the man i\\' the moon do seem to be.this is the greatest error of all the rest.the man should be put into the lanthorn : how is it else the man i\\' the moon ?he dares not come there for the candle;for,you see,it is already in snuff.i am aweary of this moon : would he would change !it appears,by his small light of discretion,that he is in the wane;but yet,in courtesy,in all reason,we must stay the time.proceed,moon.all that i have to say,is,to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon;i,the man in the moon;this thorn-bush,my thorn-bush;and this dog,my dog.why,all these should be in the lanthorn;for all these are in the moon.but,silence ! here comes thisbe.this is old ninny\\'s tomb.where is my love ?oh.well roared,lion.well run,thisbe.well shone,moon.truly,the moon shines with a good grace.well moused,lion.and then came pyramus.and so the lion vanished.sweet moon,i thank thee for thy sunny beams;i thank thee,moon,for shining now so bright,for,by thy gracious,golden,glittering streams,i trust to taste of truest thisby\\'s sight.but stay,o spite !but mark,poor knight,what dreadful dole is here !eyes,do you see ?how can it be ?o dainty duck ! o dear !thy mantle good,what ! stain\\'d with blood !approach,ye furies fell !o fates,come,come,cut thread and thrum;quail,crush,conclude,and quell !this passion,and the death of a dear friend,would go near to make a man look sad.beshrew my heart,but i pity the man.o ! wherefore,nature,didst thou lions frame ?since lion vile hath here deflower\\'d my dear ?which is no,no which was the fairest dame that liv\\'d,that lov\\'d,that lik\\'d,that look\\'d with cheer.come tears,confound;out,sword,and wound the pap of pyramus :ay,that left pap,where heart doth hop :thus die i,thus,thus,thus.now am i dead,now am i fled;my soul is in the sky :tongue,lose thy light !moon,take thy flight !now die,die,die,die,die.no die,but an ace,for him;for he is but one.less than an ace,man,for he is dead;he is nothing.with the help of a surgeon,he might yet recover,and prove an ass.how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ?she will find him by starlight.here she comes;and her passion ends the play.methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus : i hope she will be brief.a mote will turn the balance,which pyramus,which thisbe,is the better : he for a man,god warrant us;she for a woman,god bless us.she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.and thus she moans,videlicet :asleep,my love ?what,dead,my dove ?o pyramus,arise !speak,speak ! quite dumb ?dead,dead ! a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes.these lily lips,this cherry nose,these yellow cowslip cheeks,are gone,are gone :lovers,make moan !his eyes were green as leeks.o,sisters three,come,come to me,with hands as pale as milk;lay them in gore,since you have shore with shears his thread of silk.tongue,not a word :come,trusty sword :come,blade,my breast imbrue :and farewell,friends;thus thisby ends :adieu,adieu,adieu.moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead.ay,and wall too.no,i assure you;the wall is down that parted their fathers.will it please you to see the epilogue,or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company ?no epilogue,i pray you;for your play needs no excuse.never excuse;for when the players are all dead,there need none to be blamed.marry,if he that writ it had played pyramus,and hanged himself in thisbe\\'s garter,it would have been a fine tragedy : and so it is,truly,and very notably discharged.but come,your bergomask : let your epilogue alone.the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve;lovers,to bed;\\'tis almost fairy time.i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,as much as we this night have overwatch\\'d.this palpable-gross play hath well beguil\\'d the heavy gait of night.sweet friends,to bed.a fortnight hold we this solemnity,in nightly revels,and new jollity.now the hungry lion roars,and the wolf behowls the moon;whilst the heavy ploughman snores,all with weary task fordone.now the wasted brands do glow,whilst the screech-owl,screeching loud,puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud.now it is the time of night that the graves,all gaping wide,every one lets forth his sprite,in the church-way paths to glide :and we fairies,that do run by the triple hecate\\'s team,from the presence of the sun,following darkness like a dream,now are frolic;not a mouse shall disturb this hallow\\'d house :i am sent with broom before,to sweep the dust behind the door.through the house give glimmering light by the dead and drowsy fire;every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier;and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly.first,rehearse your song by rote,to each word a warbling note :hand in hand,with fairy grace,will we sing,and bless this place.now,until the break of day,through this house each fairy stray.to the best bride-bed will we,which by us shall blessed be;and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate.so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be;and the blots of nature\\'s hand shall not in their issue stand :never mole,hare-lip,nor scar,nor mark prodigious,such as are despised in nativity,shall upon their children be.with this field-dew consecrate,every fairy take his gait,and each several chamber bless,through this palace,with sweet peace;ever shall in safety rest,and the owner of it blest.trip away;make no stay;meet me all by break of day.if we shadows have offended,think but this,and all is mended,that you have but slumber\\'d here while these visions did appear.and this weak and idle theme,no more yielding but a dream,gentles,do not reprehend :if you pardon,we will mend.and,as i\\'m an honest puck,if we have unearned luck now to \\'scape the serpent\\'s tongue,we will make amends ere long;else the puck a liar call :so,good night unto you all.give me your hands,if we be friends,and robin shall restore amends.alls well that ends wellin delivering my son from me,i bury a second husband.and i,in going,madam,weep o\\'er my father\\'s death anew;but i must attend his majesty\\'s command,to whom i am now in ward,evermore in subjection.you shall find of the king a husband,madam;you,sir,a father.he that so generally is at all times good,must of necessity hold his virtue to you,whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.what hope is there of his majesty\\'s amendment ?he hath abandoned his physicians,madam;under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope,and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.this young gentlewoman had a father,o,that \\'had !\\' how sad a passage \\'tis !whose skill was almost as great as his honesty;had it stretched so far,would have made nature immortal,and death should have play for lack of work.would,for the king\\'s sake,he were living ! i think it would be the death of the king\\'s disease.how called you the man you speak of,madam ?he was famous,sir,in his profession,and it was his great right to be so : gerard de narbon.he was excellent indeed,madam : the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly.he was skilful enough to have lived still,if knowledge could be set up against mortality.what is it,my good lord,the king languishes of ?a fistula,my lord.i heard not of it before.i would it were not notorious.was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon ?his sole child,my lord;and bequeathed to my overlooking.i have those hopes of her good that her education promises : her dispositions she inherits,which makes fair gifts fairer;for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,there commendations go with pity;they are virtues and traitors too : in her they are the better for their simpleness;she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.your commendations,madam,get from her tears.\\'tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek.no more of this,helena,go to,no more;lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow,than have it.i do affect a sorrow indeed,but i have it too.moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,excessive grief the enemy to the living.if the living be enemy to the grief,the excess makes it soon mortal.madam,i desire your holy wishes.how understand we that ?be thou blest,bertram;and succeed thy father in manners,as in shape ! thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee;and thy goodness share with thy birthright ! love all,trust a few,do wrong to none : be able for thine enemy rather in power than use,and keep thy friend under thy own life\\'s key : be check\\'d for silence,but never tax\\'d for speech.what heaven more will that thee may furnish,and my prayers pluck down,fall on thy head ! farewell,my lord;\\'tis an unseason\\'d courtier;good my lord,advise him.he cannot want the best that shall attend his love.heaven bless him ! farewell,bertram.the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you ! be comfortable to my mother,your mistress,and make much of her.farewell,pretty lady : you must hold the credit of your father.o ! were that all.i think not on my father;and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him.what was he like ?i have forgot him : my imagination carries no favour in\\'t but bertram\\'s.i am undone : there is no living,none,if bertram be away.it were all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it,he is so above me :in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted,not in his sphere.the ambition in my love thus plagues itself :the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love.\\'twas pretty,though a plague,to see him every hour;to sit and draw his arched brows,his hawking eye,his curls,in our heart\\'s table;heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour :but now he\\'s gone,and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques.who comes here ?one that goes with him : i love him for his sake;and yet i know him a notorious liar,think him a great way fool,solely a coward;yet these fix\\'d evils sit so fit in him,that they take place,when virtue\\'s steely bones look bleak in the cold wind : withal,full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.save you,fair queen !and you,monarch !no.and no.are you meditating on virginity ?ay.you have some stain of soldier in you;let me ask you a question.man is enemy to virginity;how may we barricado it against him ?keep him out.but he assails;and our virginity,though valiant in the defence,yet is weak.unfold to us some war-like resistance.there is none : man,sitting down before you,will undermine you and blow you up.bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up ! is there no military policy,how virgins might blow up men ?virginity being blown down,man will quicklier be blown up : marry in blowing him down again,with the breach yourselves made,you lose your city.it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity.loss of virginity is rational increase,and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost.that you were made of is metal to make virgins.virginity,by being once lost,may be ten times found : by being ever kept,it is ever lost.\\'tis too cold a companion : away with\\'t !i will stand for\\'t a little,though therefore i die a virgin.there\\'s little can be said in\\'t;\\'tis against the rule of nature.to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers,which is most infallible disobedience.he that hangs himself is a virgin : virginity murders itself,and should be buried in highways,out of all sanctified limit,as a desperate offendress against nature.virginity breeds mites,much like a cheese,consumes itself to the very paring,and so dies with feeding his own stomach.besides,virginity is peevish,proud,idle,made of self-love,which is the most inhibited sin in the canon.keep it not;you cannot choose but lose by\\'t ! out with\\'t ! within the year it will make itself two,which is a goodly increase,and the principal itself not much the worse.away with\\'t !how might one do,sir,to lose it to her own liking ?let me see : marry,ill,to like him that ne\\'er it likes.\\'tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying;the longer kept,the less worth : off with\\'t,while \\'tis vendible;answer the time of request.virginity,like an old courtier,wears her cap out of fashion;richly suited,but unsuitable : just like the brooch and the toothpick,which wear not now.your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek : and your virginity,your old virginity,is like one of our french withered pears;it looks ill,it eats drily;marry,\\'tis a withered pear;it was formerly better;marry,yet \\'tis a withered pear.will you anything with it ?not my virginity yet.there shall your master have a thousand loves,a mother,and a mistress,and a friend,a ph nix,captain,and an enemy,a guide,a goddess,and a sovereign,a counsellor,a traitress,and a dear;his humble ambition,proud humility,his jarring concord,and his discord dulcet,his faith,his sweet disaster;with a world of pretty,fond,adoptious christendoms,that blinking cupid gossips.now shall he i know not what he shall.god send him well !the court\\'s a learning-place,and he is one what one,i\\' faith ?that i wish well.\\'tis pity what\\'s pity ?that wishing well had not a body in\\'t,which might be felt;that we,the poorer born,whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,might with effects of them follow our friends,and show what we alone must think,which never returns us thanks.monsieur parolles,my lord calls for you.little helen,farewell : if i can remember thee,i will think of thee at court.monsieur parolles,you were born under a charitable star.under mars,i.i especially think,under mars.why under mars ?the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars.when he was predominant.when he was retrograde,i think rather.why think you so ?you go so much backward when you fight.that\\'s for advantage.so is running away,when fear proposes the safety : but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing,and i like the wear well.i am so full of businesses i cannot answer thee acutely.i will return perfect courtier;in the which,my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee,so thou wilt be capable of a courtier\\'s counsel,and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee;else thou diest in thine unthankfulness,and thine ignorance makes thee away : farewell.when thou hast leisure,say thy prayers;when thou hast none,remember thy friends.get thee a good husband,and use him as he uses thee : so,farewell.our remedies oft in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven : the fated sky gives us free scope;only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.what power is it which mounts my love so high;that makes me see,and cannot feed mine eye ?the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes,and kiss like native things.impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense,and do suppose what hath been cannot be : who ever strove to show her merit,that did miss her love ?the king\\'s disease,my project may deceive me,but my intents are fix\\'d and will not leave me.the florentines and senoys are by the ears;have fought with equal fortune,and continue a braving war.so \\'tis reported,sir.nay,\\'tis most credible : we here receive it a certainty,vouch\\'d from our cousin austria,with caution that the florentine will move us for speedy aid;wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business,and would seem to have us make denial.his love and wisdom,approv\\'d so to your majesty,may plead for amplest credence.he hath arm\\'d our answer,and florence is denied before he comes :yet,for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service,freely have they leave to stand on either part.it well may serve a nursery to our gentry,who are sick for breathing and exploit.what\\'s he comes here ?it is the count rousillon,my good lord,young betram.youth,thou bear\\'st thy father\\'s face;frank nature,rather curious than in haste,hath well compos\\'d thee.thy father\\'s moral parts mayst thou inherit too ! welcome to paris.my thanks and duty are your majesty\\'s.i would i had that corporal soundness now,as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership ! he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest : he lasted long;but on us both did haggish age steal on,and wore us out of act.it much repairs me to talk of your good father.in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe to-day in our young lords;but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour.so like a courtier,contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness;if they were,his equal had awak\\'d them;and his honour,clock to itself,knew the true minute when exception bid him speak,and at this time his tongue obey\\'d his hand : who were below him he us\\'d as creatures of another place,and bow\\'d his eminent top to their low ranks,making them proud of his humility,in their poor praise he humbled.such a man might be a copy to these younger times,which,follow\\'d well,would demonstrate them now but goers backward.his good remembrance,sir,lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech.would i were with him ! he would always say,methinks i hear him now : his plausive words he scatter\\'d not in ears,but grafted them,to grow there and to bear.\\'let me not live,\\' thus his good melancholy oft began,on the catastrophe and heel of pastime,when it was out,\\'let me not live,\\' quoth he,\\'after my flame lacks oil,to be the snuff of younger spirits,whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain;whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments;whose constancies expire before their fashions.\\' this he wish\\'d :i,after him,do after him wish too,since i nor wax nor honey can bring home,i quickly were dissolved from my hive,to give some labourers room.you are lov\\'d,sir;they that least lend it you shall lack you first.i fill a place,i know\\'t.how long is\\'t,count,since the physician at your father\\'s died ?he was much fam\\'d.some six months since,my lord.if he were living,i would try him yet :lend me an arm : the rest have worn me out with several applications : nature and sickness debate it at their leisure.welcome,count;my son\\'s no dearer.thank your majesty.i will now hear : what say you of this gentlewoman ?madam,the care i have had to even your content,i wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours;for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings,when of ourselves we publish them.what does this knave here ? get you gone,sirrah : the complaints i have heard of you i do not all believe : \\'tis my slowness that i do not;for i know you lack not folly to commit them,and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.\\'tis not unknown to you,madam,i am a poor fellow.well,sir.no,madam,\\'tis not so well that i am poor,though many of the rich are damned.but,if i may have your ladyship\\'s good will to go to the world,isbel the woman and i will do as we may.wilt thou needs be a beggar ?i do beg your good will in this case.in what case ?in isbel\\'s case and mine own.service is no heritage;and i think i shall never have the blessing of god till i have issue o\\' my body,for they say barnes are blessings.tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.my poor body,madam,requires it : i am driven on by the flesh;and he must needs go that the devil drives.is this all your worship\\'s reason ?faith,madam,i have other holy reasons,such as they are.may the world know them ?i have been,madam,a wicked creature,as you and all flesh and blood are;and,indeed,i do marry that i may repent.thy marriage,sooner than thy wickedness.i am out o\\' friends,madam;and i hope to have friends for my wife\\'s sake.such friends are thine enemies,knave.you\\'re shallow,madam,in great friends;for the knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of.he that ears my land spares my team,and gives me leave to in the crop : if i be his cuckold,he\\'s my drudge.he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood;he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood;he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend : ergo,he that kisses my wife is my friend.if men could be contented to be what they are,there were no fear in marriage;for young charbon the puritan,and old poysam the papist,howsome\\'er their hearts are severed in religion,their heads are both one;they may joul horns together like any deer i\\' the herd.wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave ?a prophet i,madam;and i speak the truth the next way :for i the ballad will repeat,which men full true shall find;your marriage comes by destiny,your cuckoo sings by kind.get you gone,sir : i\\'ll talk with you more anon.may it please you,madam,that he bid helen come to you : of her i am to speak.sirrah,tell my gentlewoman i would speak with her;helen i mean.was this fair face the cause,quoth she,why the grecians sacked troy ?fond done,done fond,was this king priam\\'s joy ?with that she sighed as she stood,with that she sighed as she stood,and gave this sentence then;among nine bad if one be good,among nine bad if one be good,there\\'s yet one good in ten.what ! one good in ten ? you corrupt the song,sirrah.one good woman in ten,madam;which is a purifying o\\' the song.would god would serve the world so all the year ! we\\'d find no fault with the tithe-woman if i were the parson.one in ten,quoth a\\' ! an we might have a good woman born but for every blazing star,or at an earthquake,\\'twould mend the lottery well : a man may draw his heart out ere a\\' pluck one.you\\'ll be gone,sir knave,and do as i command you !that man should be at woman\\'s command,and yet no hurt done ! though honesty be no puritan,yet it will do no hurt;it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.i am going,forsooth : the business is for helen to come hither.well,now.i know,madam,you love your gentlewoman entirely.faith,i do : her father bequeathed her to me;and she herself,without other advantage,may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds : there is more owing her than is paid,and more shall be paid her than she\\'ll demand.madam,i was very late more near her than i think she wished me : alone she was,and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears;she thought,i dare vow for her,they touched not any stranger sense.her matter was,she loved your son : fortune,she said,was no goddess,that had put such difference betwixt their two estates;love no god,that would not extend his might,only where qualities were level;dian no queen of virgins,that would suffer her poor knight surprised,without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.this she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e\\'er i heard virgin exclaim in;which i held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal,sithence in the loss that may happen,it concerns you something to know it.you have discharged this honestly : keep it to yourself.many likelihoods informed me of this before,which hung so tottering in the balance that i could neither believe nor misdoubt.pray you,leave me : stall this in your bosom;and i thank you for your honest care.i will speak with you further anon.even so it was with me when i was young :if ever we are nature\\'s,these are ours;this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;our blood to us,this to our blood is born :it is the show and seal of nature\\'s truth,where love\\'s strong passion is impress\\'d in youth :by our remembrances of days foregone,such were our faults;or then we thought them none.her eye is sick on\\'t : i observe her now.what is your pleasure,madam ?you know,helen,i am a mother to you.mine honourable mistress.nay,a mother :why not a mother ? when i said,\\'a mother,\\' methought you saw a serpent : what\\'s in \\'mother\\' that you start at it ? i say,i am your mother;and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine : \\'tis often seen adoption strives with nature,and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds;you ne\\'er oppress\\'d me with a mother\\'s groan,yet i express to you a mother\\'s care.god\\'s mercy,maiden ! does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother ? what\\'s the matter,that this distemper\\'d messenger of wet,the many-colour\\'d iris,rounds thine eye ?why ? that you are my daughter ?that i am not.i say,i am your mother.pardon,madam;the count rousillon cannot be my brother :i am from humble,he from honour\\'d name;no note upon my parents,his all noble :my master,my dear lord he is;and i his servant live,and will his vassal die.he must not be my brother.nor i your mother ?you are my mother,madam : would you were,so that my lord your son were not my brother,indeed my mother ! or were you both our mothers,i care no more for than i do for heaven,so i were not his sister.can\\'t no other,but,i your daughter,he must be my brother ?yes,helen,you might be my daughter-in-law :god shield you mean it not ! daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse.what,pale again ?my fear hath catch\\'d your fondness : now i see the mystery of your loneliness,and find your salt tears\\' head : now to all sense \\'tis gross you love my son : invention is asham\\'d,against the proclamation of thy passion,to say thou dost not : therefore tell me true;but tell me then,\\'tis so;for,look,thy cheeks confess it,th\\' one to th\\' other;and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviours that in their kind they speak it : only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,that truth should be suspected.speak,is\\'t so ?if it be so,you have wound a goodly clew;if it be not,forswear\\'t : howe\\'er,i charge thee,as heaven shall work in me for thine avail,to tell me truly.good madam,pardon me !do you love my son ?your pardon,noble mistress !love you my son ?do not you love him,madam ?go not about;my love hath in\\'t a bond whereof the world takes note : come,come,disclose the state of your affection,for your passions have to the full appeach\\'d.then,i confess,here on my knee,before high heaven and you that before you,and next unto high heaven,i love your son.my friends were poor,but honest;so\\'s my love :be not offended,for it hurts not him that he is lov\\'d of me : i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit;nor would i have him till i do deserve him;yet never know how that desert should be.i know i love in vain,strive against hope;yet,in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love,and lack not to lose still.thus,indian-like,religious in mine error,i adore the sun,that looks upon his worshipper,but knows of him no more.my dearest madam,let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do : but,if yourself,whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly,that your dian was both herself and love;o ! then,give pity to her,whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose;that seeks not to find that her search implies,but,riddle-like,lives sweetly where she dies.had you not lately an intent,speak truly,to go to paris ?madam,i had.wherefore ? tell true.i will tell truth;by grace itself i swear.you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and prov\\'d effects,such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty;and that he will\\'d me in heedfull\\'st reservation to bestow them,as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note.amongst the rest,there is a remedy,approv\\'d,set down to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render\\'d lost.this was your motive for paris,was it ? speak.my lord your son made me to think of this;else paris,and the medicine,and the king,had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then.but think you,helen,if you should tender your supposed aid,he would receive it ? he and his physicians are of a mind;he,that they cannot help him,they,that they cannot help.how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin,when the schools,embowell\\'d of their doctrine,have left off the danger to itself ?there\\'s something in\\'t,more than my father\\'s skill,which was the great\\'st of his profession,that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven : and,would your honour but give me leave to try success,i\\'d venture the well-lost life of mine on his grace\\'s cure,by such a day,and hour.dost thou believe\\'t ?ay,madam,knowingly.why,helen,thou shalt have my leave and love,means,and attendants,and my loving greetings to those of mine in court.i\\'ll stay at home and pray god\\'s blessing into thy attempt.be gone to-morrow;and be sure of this,what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss.farewell,young lords : these war-like principles do not throw from you : and you,my lords,farewell :share the advice betwixt you;if both gain,all the gift doth stretch itself as \\'tis receiv\\'d,and is enough for both.\\'tis our hope,sir,after well enter\\'d soldiers,to return and find your grace in health.no,no,it cannot be;and yet my heart will not confess he owes the malady that doth my life besiege.farewell,young lords;whether i live or die,be you the sons of worthy frenchmen : let higher italy those bated that inherit but the fall of the last monarchy see that you come not to woo honour,but to wed it;when the bravest questant shrinks,find what you seek that fame may cry you loud : i say,farewell.health,at your bidding,serve your majesty !those girls of italy,take heed of them :they say,our french lack language to deny if they demand : beware of being captives,before you serve.our hearts receive your warnings.farewell.come hither to me.o my sweet lord,that you will stay behind us !\\'tis not his fault,the spark.o ! \\'tis brave wars.most admirable : i have seen those wars.i am commanded here,and kept a coil with \\'too young,\\' and \\'the next year,\\' and \\'\\'tis too early.\\' an thy mind stand to\\'t,boy,steal away bravely.i shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,till honour be bought up and no sword worn but one to dance with ! by heaven ! i\\'ll steal away.there\\'s honour in the theft.commit it,count.i am your accessary;and so farewell.i grow to you,and our parting is a tortured body.farewell,captain.sweet monsieur parolles !noble heroes,my sword and yours are kin.good sparks and lustrous,a word,good metals : you shall find in the regiment of the spinii,one captain spurio,with his cicatrice,an emblem of war,here on his sinister cheek : it was this very sword entrenched it : say to him,i live,and observe his reports for me we shall,noble captain.mars dote on you for his novices ! what will ye do ?stay;the king.use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords;you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu : be more expressive to them;for they wear themselves in the cap of the time,there do muster true gait,eat,speak,and move under the influence of the most received star;and though the devil lead the measure,such are to be followed.after them,and take a more dilated farewell.and i will do so.worthy fellows;and like to prove most sinewy swordmen.pardon,my lord,for me and for my tidings.i\\'ll fee thee to stand up.then here\\'s a man stands that has brought his pardon.i would you had kneel\\'d,my lord,to ask me mercy,and that at my bidding you could so stand up.i would i had;so i had broke thy pate,and ask\\'d thee mercy for\\'t.good faith,across : but,my good lord,\\'tis thus;will you be cur\\'d of your infirmity ?no.o ! will you eat no grapes,my royal fox ?yes,but you will my noble grapes an if my royal fox could reach them.i have seen a medicine that\\'s able to breathe life into a stone,quicken a rock,and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion;whose simple touch is powerful to araise king pepin,nay,to give great charlemain a pen in\\'s hand and write to her a love-line.what \\'her\\' is this ?why,doctor she.my lord,there\\'s one arriv\\'d if you will see her : now,by my faith and honour,if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance,i have spoke with one,that in her sex,her years,profession,wisdom,and constancy,hath amaz\\'d me more than i dare blame my weakness.will you see her,for that is her demand,and know her business ?that done,laugh well at me.now,good lafeu,bring in the admiration,that we with thee may spend our wonder too,or take off thine by wond\\'ring how thou took\\'st it.nay,i\\'ll fit you,and not be all day neither.thus he his special nothing ever prologues.nay,come your ways.this haste hath wings indeed.nay,come your ways;this is his majesty,say your mind to him :a traitor you do look like;but such traitors his majesty seldom fears : i am cressid\\'s uncle,that dare leave two together.fare you well.now,fair one,does your business follow us ?ay,my good lord.gerard de narbon was my father;in what he did profess well found.i knew him.the rather will i spare my praises towards him;knowing him is enough.on\\'s bed of death many receipts he gave me;chiefly one,which,as the dearest issue of his practice,and of his old experience the only darling,he bade me store up as a triple eye,safer than mine own two,more dear.i have so;and,hearing your high majesty is touch\\'d with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear father\\'s gift stands chief in power,i come to tender it and my appliance,with all bound humbleness.we thank you,maiden;but may not be so credulous of cure,when our most learned doctors leave us,and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidable estate;i say we must not so stain our judgment,or corrupt our hope,to prostitute our past-cure malady to empirics,or to dissever so our great self and our credit,to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem.my duty then,shall pay me for my pains :i will no more enforce mine office on you;humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one,to bear me back again.i cannot give thee less,to be call\\'d grateful.thou thought\\'st to help me,and such thanks i give as one near death to those that wish him live;but what at full i know,thou know\\'st no part,i knowing all my peril,thou no art.what i can do can do no hurt to try,since you set up your rest \\'gainst remedy.he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister :so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,when judges have been babes;great floods have flown from simple sources;and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied.oft expectation fails,and most oft there where most it promises;and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits.i must not hear thee : fare thee well,kind maid.thy pains,not us\\'d,must by thyself be paid :proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.inspired merit so by breath is barr\\'d.it is not so with him that all things knows,as \\'tis with us that square our guess by shows;but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men.dear sir,to my endeavours give consent;of heaven,not me,make an experiment.i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim;but know i think,and think i know most sure,my art is not past power nor you past cure.art thou so confident ? within what space hop\\'st thou my cure ?the great\\'st grace lending grace,ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quench\\'d his sleepy lamp,or four and twenty times the pilot\\'s glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,health shall live free,and sickness freely die.upon thy certainty and confidence what dar\\'st thou venture ?tax of impudence,a strumpet\\'s boldness,a divulged shame,traduc\\'d by odious ballads : my maiden\\'s name sear\\'d otherwise;nay worse if worse extended with vilest torture let my life be ended.methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak,his powerful sound within an organ weak;and what impossibility would slay in common sense,sense saves another way.thy life is dear;for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate;youth,beauty,wisdom,courage,virtue,all that happiness and prime can happy call :thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate.sweet practiser,thy physic i will try,that ministers thine own death if i die.if i break time,or flinch in property of what i spoke,unpitied let me die,and well deserv\\'d.not helping,death\\'s my fee;but,if i help,what do you promise me ?make thy demand.but will you make it even ?ay,by my sceptre,and my hopes of heaven.then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand what husband in thy power i will command :exempted be from me the arrogance to choose from forth the royal blood of france,my low and humble name to propagate with any branch or image of thy state;but such a one,thy vassal,whom i know is free for me to ask,thee to bestow.here is my hand;the premises observ\\'d,thy will by my performance shall be serv\\'d :so make the choice of thy own time,for i,thy resolv\\'d patient,on thee still rely.more should i question thee,and more i must,though more to know could not be more to trust,from whence thou cam\\'st,how tended on;but rest unquestion\\'d welcome and undoubted blest.give me some help here,ho ! if thou proceed as high as word,my deed shall match thy deed.come on,sir;i shall now put you to the height of your breeding.i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught.i know my business is but to the court.to the court ! why what place make you special,when you put off that with such contempt ? \\'but to the court !\\' truly,madam,if god have lent a man any manners,he may easily put it off at court : he that cannot make a leg,put off\\'s cap,kiss his hand,and say nothing,has neither leg,hands,lip,nor cap;and indeed such a fellow,to say precisely,were not for the court.but,for me,i have an answer will serve all men.marry,that\\'s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.it is like a barber\\'s chair that fits all buttocks;the pin-buttock,the quatch-buttock,the brawn-buttock,or any buttock.will your answer serve fit to all questions ?as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,as your french crown for your taffeta punk,as tib\\'s rush for tom\\'s forefinger,as a pancake for shrove-tuesday,a morris for mayday,as the nail to his hole,the cuckold to his horn,as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave,as the nun\\'s lip to the friar\\'s mouth;nay,as the pudding to his skin.have you,i say,an answer of such fitness for all questions ?from below your duke to beneath your constable,it will fit any question.it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.but a trifle neither,in good faith,if the learned should speak truth of it.here it is,and all that belongs to\\'t : ask me if i am a courtier;it shall do you no harm to learn.to be young again,if we could.i will be a fool in question,hoping to be the wiser by your answer.i pray you,sir,are you a courtier ?o lord,sir ! there\\'s a simple putting off.more,more,a hundred of them.sir,i am a poor friend of yours,that loves you.o lord,sir ! thick,thick,spare not me.i think,sir,you can eat none of this homely meat.o lord,sir ! nay,put me to\\'t,i warrant you.you were lately whipped,sir,as i think.o lord,sir ! spare not me.do you cry,\\'o lord,sir !\\' at your whipping,and \\'spare not me ?\\' indeed your \\'o lord,sir !\\' is very sequent to your whipping : you would answer very well to a whipping,if you were but bound to\\'t.i ne\\'er had worse luck in my life in my \\'o lord,sir !\\' i see things may serve long,but not serve ever.i play the noble housewife with the time,to entertain\\'t so merrily with a fool.o lord,sir ! why,there\\'t serves well again.an end,sir : to your business.give helen this,and urge her to a present answer back :commend me to my kinsmen and my son.this is not much.not much commendation to them.not much employment for you : you understand me ?most fruitfully : i am there before my legs.haste you again.they say miracles are past;and we have our philosophical persons,to make modern and familiar,things supernatural and causeless.hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge,when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.why,\\'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.and so \\'tis.to be relinquished of the artists,so i say.both of galen and paracelsus.so i say.of all the learned and authentic fellows,right;so i say.that gave him out incurable,why,there \\'tis;so say i too.not to be helped,right;as \\'twere,a man assured of a uncertain life,and sure death.just,you say well : so would i have said.i may truly say it is a novelty to the world.it is,indeed : if you will have it in showing,you shall read it in what do you call there a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.that\\'s it i would have said;the very same.why,your dolphin is not lustier : \\'fore me,i speak in respect nay,\\'tis strange,\\'tis very strange,that is the brief and the tedious of it;and he is of a most facinorous spirit,that will not acknowledge it to be the very hand of heaven ay,so i say.in a most weak and debile minister,great power,great transcendence : which should,indeed,give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king,as to be generally thankful.i would have said it;you say well.here comes the king.lustig,as the dutchman says : i\\'ll like a maid the better,whilst i have a tooth in my head.why,he\\'s able to lead her a coranto.mort du vinaigre ! is not this helen ?\\'fore god,i think so.go,call before me all the lords in court.sit,my preserver,by thy patient\\'s side :and with this healthful hand,whose banish\\'d sense thou hast repeal\\'d,a second time receive the confirmation of my promised gift,which but attends thy naming.fair maid,send forth thine eye : this youthful parcel of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,o\\'er whom both sov\\'reign power and father\\'s voice i have to use : thy frank election make;thou hast power to choose,and they none to forsake.to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress fall,when love please ! marry,to each,but one.i\\'d give bay curtal,and his furniture,my mouth no more were broken than these boys\\' and writ as little beard.peruse them well :not one of those but had a noble father.gentlemen,heaven hath through me restor\\'d the king to health.we understand it,and thank heaven for you.i am a simple maid;and therein wealthiest that i protest i simply am a maid.please it your majesty,i have done already :the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,\\'we blush,that thou shouldst choose;but,be refus\\'d,let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;we\\'ll ne\\'er come there again.\\' make choice;and see,who shuns thy love,shuns all his love in me.now,dian,from thy altar do i fly,and to imperial love,that god most high,do my sighs stream.sir,will you hear my suit ?and grant it.thanks,sir;all the rest is mute.i had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.the honour,sir,that flames in your fair eyes,before i speak,too threateningly replies :love make your fortunes twenty times above her that so wishes,and her humble love !no better,if you please.my wish receive,which great love grant ! and so i take my leave.do all they deny her ? an they were sons of mine,i\\'d have them whipp\\'d or i would send them to the turk to make eunuchs of.be not afraid that i your hand should take;i\\'ll never do you wrong for your own sake :blessing upon your vows ! and in your bed find fairer fortune,if you ever wed !these boys are boys of ice,they\\'ll none have her : sure,they are bastards to the english;the french ne\\'er got \\'em.you are too young,too happy,and too good,to make yourself a son out of my blood.fair one,i think not so.there\\'s one grape yet.i am sure thy father drunk wine.but if thou be\\'st not an ass,i am a youth of fourteen : i have known thee already.i dare not say i take you;but i give me and my service,ever whilst i live,into your guiding power.this is the man.why then,young bertram,take her;she\\'s thy wife.my wife,my liege ! i shall beseech your highness in such a business give me leave to use the help of mine own eyes.know\\'st thou not,bertram,what she has done for me ?yes,my good lord;but never hope to know why i should marry her.thou know\\'st she has rais\\'d me from my sickly bed.but follows it,my lord,to bring me down must answer for your raising ? i know her well :she had her breeding at my father\\'s charge.a poor physician\\'s daughter my wife ! disdain rather corrupt me ever !\\'tis only title thou disdain\\'st in her,the which i can build up.strange is it that our bloods,of colour,weight,and heat,pour\\'d all together,would quite confound distinction,yet stand off in differences so mighty.if she be all that is virtuous,save what thou dislik\\'st,a poor physician\\'s daughter,thou dislik\\'st of virtue for the name;but do not so :from lowest place when virtuous things proceed,the place is dignified by the doer\\'s deed :where great additions swell\\'s,and virtue none,it is a dropsied honour.good alone is good without a name : vileness is so :the property by what it is should go,not by the title.she is young,wise,fair;in these to nature she\\'s immediate heir,and these breed honour : that is honour\\'s scorn which challenges itself as honour\\'s born,and is not like the sire : honours thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers.the mere word\\'s a slave,debosh\\'d on every tomb,on every grave a lying trophy,and as oft is dumb where dust and damn\\'d oblivion is the tomb of honour\\'d bones indeed.what should be said ?if thou canst like this creature as a maid,i can create the rest : virtue and she is her own dower;honour and wealth from me.i cannot love her,nor will strive to do\\'t.thou wrong\\'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose.that you are well restor\\'d,my lord,i\\'m glad :let the rest go.my honour\\'s at the stake,which to defeat i must produce my power.here,take her hand,proud scornful boy,unworthy this good gift,that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert;thou canst not dream we,poising us in her defective scale,shall weigh thee to the beam;that wilt not know,it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow.check thy contempt :obey our will,which travails in thy good :believe not thy disdain,but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims;or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance;both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee,in the name of justice,without all terms of pity.speak;thine answer.pardon,my gracious lord;for i submit my fancy to your eyes.when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it,i find that she,which late was in my nobler thoughts most base,is now the praised of the king;who,so ennobled,is,as \\'twere,born so.take her by the hand,and tell her she is thine : to whom i promise a counterpoise,if not to thy estate a balance more replete.i take her hand.good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract;whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,and be perform\\'d to-night : the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space,expecting absent friends.as thou lov\\'st her,thy love\\'s to me religious;else,does err.do you hear,monsieur ? a word with you.your pleasure,sir ?your lord and master did well to make his recantation.recantation ! my lord ! my master !ay;is it not a language i speak ?a most harsh one,and not to be understood without bloody succeeding.my master !are you companion to the count rousillon ?to any count;to all counts;to what is man.to what is count\\'s man : count\\'s master is of another style.you are too old,sir;let it satisfy you,you are too old.i must tell thee,sirrah,i write man;to which title age cannot bring thee.what i dare too well do,i dare not do.i did think thee,for two ordinaries,to be a pretty wise fellow : thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel;it might pass : yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden.i have now found thee;when i lose thee again,i care not;yet art thou good for nothing but taking up,and that thou\\'rt scarce worth.hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,do not plunge thyself too far in anger,lest thou hasten thy trial;which if lord have mercy on thee for a hen ! so,my good window of lattice,fare thee well : thy casement i need not open,for i look through thee.give me thy hand.my lord,you give me most egregious indignity.ay,with all my heart;and thou art worthy of it.i have not,my lord,deserved it.yes,good faith,every dram of it;and i will not bate thee a scruple.well,i shall be wiser.e\\'en as soon as thou canst,for thou hast to pull at a smack o\\' the contrary.if ever thou be\\'st bound in thy scarf and beaten,thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage.i have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee,or rather my knowledge,that i may say in the default,he is a man i know.my lord,you do me most insupportable vexation.i would it were hell-pains for thy sake,and my poor doing eternal : for doing i am past;as i will by thee,in what motion age will give me leave.well,thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me;scurvy,old,filthy,scurvy lord ! well,i must be patient;there is no fettering of authority.i\\'ll beat him,by my life,if i can meet him with any convenience,an he were double and double a lord.i\\'ll have no more pity of his age than i would have of i\\'ll beat him,an if i could but meet him again !sirrah,your lord and master\\'s married;there\\'s news for you : you have a new mistress.i most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs : he is my good lord : whom i serve above is my master.who ? god ?ay,sir.the devil it is that\\'s thy master.why dost thou garter up thy arms o\\' this fashion ? dost make hose of thy sleeves ? do other servants so ? thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands.by mine honour,if i were but two hours younger,i\\'d beat thee : methinks thou art a general offence,and every man should beat thee : i think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.this is hard and undeserved measure,my lord.go to,sir;you were beaten in italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate;you are a vagabond and no true traveller : you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the heraldry of your birth and virtue gives you commission.you are not worth another word,else i\\'d call you knave.i leave you.good,very good;it is so then : good,very good.let it be concealed awhile.undone,and forfeited to cares for ever !what is the matter,sweet heart ?although before the solemn priest i have sworn,i will not bed her.what,what,sweet heart ?o my parolles,they have married me !i\\'ll to the tuscan wars,and never bed her.france is a dog-hole,and it no more merits the tread of a man\\'s foot.to the wars !there\\'s letters from my mother : what the import is i know not yet.ay,that would be known.to the wars,my boy ! to the wars !he wears his honour in a box,unseen,that hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,spending his manly marrow in her arms,which should sustain the bound and high curvet of mars\\'s fiery steed.to other regions !france is a stable;we that dwell in\\'t jades;therefore,to the war !it shall be so : i\\'ll send her to my house,acquaint my mother with my hate to her,and wherefore i am fled;write to the king that which i durst not speak : his present gift shall furnish me to those italian fields,where noble fellows strike.war is no strife to the dark house and the detested wife.will this capriccio hold in thee ? art sure ?go with me to my chamber,and advise me.i\\'ll send her straight away : to-morrow i\\'ll to the wars,she to her single sorrow.why,these balls bound;there\\'s noise in it.\\'tis hard :a young man married is a man that\\'s marr\\'d :therefore away,and leave her bravely;go :the king has done you wrong : but,hush ! \\'tis so.my mother greets me kindly : is she well ?she is not well;but yet she has her health;she\\'s very merry;but yet she is not well : but thanks be given,she\\'s very well,and wants nothing i\\' the world;but yet she is not well.if she be very well,what does she ail that she\\'s not very well ?truly,she\\'s very well indeed,but for two things.what two things ?one,that she\\'s not in heaven,whither god send her quickly ! the other,that she\\'s in earth,from whence god send her quickly !bless you,my fortunate lady !i hope,sir,i have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.you had my prayers to lead them on;and to keep them on,have them still.o ! my knave,how does my old lady ?so that you had her wrinkles,and i her money,i would she did as you say.why,i say nothing.marry,you are the wiser man;for many a man\\'s tongue shakes out his master\\'s undoing.to say nothing,to do nothing,to know nothing,and to have nothing,is to be a great part of your title;which is within a very little of nothing.away ! thou\\'rt a knave.you should have said,sir,before a knave thou\\'rt a knave;that is,before me thou\\'rt a knave : this had been truth,sir.go to,thou art a witty fool;i have found thee.did you find me in yourself,sir ? or were you taught to find me ? the search,sir,was profitable;and much fool may you find in you,even to the world\\'s pleasure and the increase of laughter.a good knave,i\\' faith,and well fed.madam,my lord will go away to-night;a very serious business calls on him.the great prerogative and rite of love,which,as your due,time claims,he does acknowledge,but puts it off to a compell\\'d restraint;whose want,and whose delay,is strew\\'d with sweets,which they distil now in the curbed time,to make the coming hour o\\'erflow with joy,and pleasure drown the brim.what\\'s his will else ?that you will take your instant leave o\\' the king,and make this haste as your own good proceeding,strengthen\\'d with what apology you think may make it probable need.what more commands he ?that,having this obtain\\'d,you presently attend his further pleasure.in everything i wait upon his will.i shall report it so.i pray you.come,sirrah.but i hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.yes,my lord,and of very valiant approof.you have it from his own deliverance.and by other warranted testimony.then my dial goes not true : i took this lark for a bunting.i do assure you,my lord,he is very great in knowledge,and accordingly valiant.i have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour;and my state that way is dangerous,since i cannot yet find in my heart to repent.here he comes;i pray you,make us friends;i will pursue the amity.these things shall be done,sir.pray you,sir,who\\'s his tailor ?sir ?o ! i know him well.ay,sir;he,sir,is a good workman,a very good tailor.is she gone to the king ?she is.will she away to-night ?as you\\'ll have her.i have writ my letters,casketed my treasure,given orders for our horses;and to-night,when i should take possession of the bride,end ere i do begin.a good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;but one that lies three thirds,and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with,should be once heard and thrice beaten.god save you,captain.is there any unkindness between my lord and you,monsieur ?i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord\\'s displeasure.you have made shift to run into\\'t,boots and spurs and all,like him that leaped into the custard;and out of it you\\'ll run again,rather than suffer question for your residence.it may be you have mistaken him,my lord.and shall do so ever,though i took him at his prayers.fare you well,my lord;and believe this of me,there can be no kernel in this light nut;the soul of this man is his clothes.trust him not in matter of heavy consequence;i have kept of them tame,and know their natures.farewell,monsieur : i have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand;but we must do good against evil.an idle lord,i swear.i think not so.why,do you not know him ?yes,i do know him well;and common speech gives him a worthy pass.here comes my clog.i have,sir,as i was commanded from you,spoke with the king,and have procur\\'d his leave for present parting;only,he desires some private speech with you.i shall obey his will.you must not marvel,helen,at my course,which holds not colour with the time,nor does the ministration and required office on my particular : prepar\\'d i was not for such a business;therefore am i found so much unsettled.this drives me to entreat you that presently you take your way for home;and rather muse than ask why i entreat you;for my respects are better than they seem,and my appointments have in them a need greater than shows itself at the first view to you that know them not.this to my mother.\\'twill be two days ere i shall see you,so i leave you to your wisdom.sir,i can nothing say,but that i am your most obedient servant.come,come,no more of that.and ever shall with true observance seek to eke out that wherein toward me my homely stars have fail\\'d to equal my great fortune.let that go :my haste is very great.farewell : hie home.pray sir,your pardon.well,what would you say ?i am not worthy of the wealth i owe,nor dare i say \\'tis mine,and yet it is;but,like a timorous thief,most fain would steal what law does vouch mine own.what would you have ?something,and scarce so much : nothing,indeed.i would not tell you what i would,my lord :faith,yes;strangers and foes do sunder,and not kiss.i pray you,stay not,but in haste to horse.i shall not break your bidding,good my lord.farewell.go thou toward home;where i will never come whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum.away ! and for our flight.bravely,coragio !so that from point to point now have you heard the fundamental reasons of this war,whose great decision hath much blood let forth,and more thirsts after.holy seems the quarrel upon your grace\\'s part;black and fearful on the opposer.therefore we marvel much our cousin france would in so just a business shut his bosom against our borrowing prayers.good my lord,the reasons of our state i cannot yield,but like a common and an outward man,that the great figure of a council frames by self-unable motion : therefore dare not say what i think of it,since i have found myself in my incertain grounds to fail as often as i guess\\'d.be it his pleasure.but i am sure the younger of our nature,that surfeit on their ease,will day by day come here for physic.welcome shall they be,and all the honours that can fly from us shall on them settle.you know your places well;when better fall,for your avails they fell.to-morrow to the field.it hath happened all as i would have had it,save that he comes not along with her.by my troth,i take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.by what observance,i pray you ?why,he will look upon his boot and sing;mend the ruff and sing;ask questions and sing;pick his teeth and sing.i know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.let me see what he writes,and when he means to come.i have no mind to isbel since i was at court.our old ling and our isbels o\\' the country are nothing like your old ling and your isbels o\\' the court : the brains of my cupid\\'s knocked out,and i begin to love,as an old man loves money,with no stomach.what have we here ?e\\'en that you have there.i have sent you a daughter-in-law : she hath recovered the king,and undone me.i have wedded her,not bedded her;and sworn to make the \\'not\\' eternal.you shall hear i am ran away : know it before the report come.if there be breadth enough in the world,i will hold a long distance.my duty to you.your unfortunate son,this is not well : rash and unbridled boy,to fly the favours of so good a king !to pluck his indignation on thy head by the misprising of a maid too virtuous for the contempt of empire !o madam ! yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady.what is the matter ?nay,there is some comfort in the news,some comfort;your son will not be killed so soon as i thought he would.why should he be killed ?so say i,madam,if he run away,as i hear he does : the danger is in standing to\\'t;that\\'s the loss of men,though it be the getting of children.here they come will tell you more;for my part,i only hear your son was run away.save you,good madam.madam,my lord is gone,for ever gone.do not say so.think upon patience.pray you,gentlemen,i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,that the first face of neither,on the start,can woman me unto \\'t : where is my son,i pray you ?madam,he\\'s gone to serve the duke of florence :we met him thitherward;for thence we came,and,after some dispatch in hand at court,thither we bend again.look on his letter,madam;here\\'s my passport.when thou canst get the ring upon my finger,which never shall come off,and show me a child begotten of thy body that i am father to,then call me husband : but in such a \\'then\\' i write a \\'never.\\' this is a dreadful sentence.brought you this letter,gentlemen ?ay,madam;and for the contents\\' sake are sorry for our pains.i prithee,lady,have a better cheer;if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,thou robb\\'st me of a moiety : he was my son,but i do wash his name out of my blood,and thou art all my child.towards florence is he ?ay,madam.and to be a soldier ?such is his noble purpose;and,believe\\'t,the duke will lay upon him all the honour that good convenience claims.return you thither ?ay,madam,with the swiftest wing of speed.till i have no wife,i have nothing in france.\\'tis bitter.find you that there ?ay,madam.\\'tis but the boldness of his hand,haply,which his heart was not consenting to.nothing in france until he have no wife !there\\'s nothing here that is too good for him but only she;and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys might tend upon,and call her hourly mistress.who was with him ?a servant only,and a gentleman which i have some time known.parolles,was it not ?ay,my good lady,he.a very tainted fellow,and full of wickedness.my son corrupts a well-derived nature with his inducement.indeed,good lady,the fellow has a deal of that too much,which holds him much to have.y\\'are welcome,gentlemen.i will entreat you,when you see my son,to tell him that his sword can never win the honour that he loses : more i\\'ll entreat you written to bear along.we serve you,madam,in that and all your worthiest affairs.not so,but as we change our courtesies.will you draw near ?\\'till i have no wife,i have nothing in france.\\' nothing in france until he has no wife !thou shalt have none,rousillon,none in france;then hast thou all again.poor lord ! is\\'t i that chase thee from thy country,and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the non-sparing war ? and is it i that drive thee from the sportive court,where thou wast shot at with fair eyes,to be the mark of smoky muskets ? o you leaden messengers,that ride upon the violent speed of fire,fly with false aim;move the still-piecing air,that sings with piercing;do not touch my lord !whoever shoots at him,i set him there;whoever charges on his forward breast,i am the caitiff that do hold him to\\'t;and,though i kill him not,i am the cause his death was so effected : better \\'twere i met the ravin lion when he roar\\'d with sharp constraint of hunger;better \\'twere that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once.no,come thou home,rousillon,whence honour but of danger wins a scar,as oft it loses all : i will be gone;my being here it is that holds thee hence :shall i stay here to do\\'t ? no,no,although the air of paradise did fan the house,and angels offic\\'d all : i will be gone,that pitiful rumour may report my flight,to consolate thine ear.come,night;end,day !for with the dark,poor thief,i\\'ll steal away.the general of our horse thou art;and we,great in our hope,lay our best love and credence upon thy promising fortune.sir,it is a charge too heavy for my strength,but yet we\\'ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake to the extreme edge of hazard.then go thou forth,and fortune play upon thy prosp\\'rous helm as thy auspicious mistress !this very day,great mars,i put myself into thy file :make me but like my thoughts,and i shall prove a lover of thy drum,hater of love.alas ! and would you take the letter of her ?might you not know she would do as she has done,by sending me a letter ? read it again.i am saint jaques\\' pilgrim,thither gone :ambitious love hath so in me offended that bare-foot plod i the cold ground upon with sainted vow my faults to have amended.write,write,that from the bloody course of war,my dearest master,your dear son,may hie :bless him at home in peace,whilst i from far his name with zealous fervour sanctify :his taken labours bid him me forgive;i,his despiteful juno,sent him forth from courtly friends,with camping foes to live,where death and danger dog the heels of worth :he is too good and fair for death and me;whom i myself embrace,to set him free.ah,what sharp stings are in her mildest words !rinaldo,you did never lack advice so much,as letting her pass so : had i spoke with her,i could have well diverted her intents,which thus she hath prevented.pardon me,madam :if i had given you this at over-night she might have been o\\'erta\\'en;and yet she writes,pursuit would be but vain.what angel shall bless this unworthy husband ? he cannot thrive,unless her prayers,whom heaven delights to hear,and loves to grant,reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice.write,write,rinaldo,to this unworthy husband of his wife;let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light : my greatest grief,though little he do feel it,set down sharply.dispatch the most convenient messenger :when haply he shall hear that she is gone,he will return;and hope i may that she,hearing so much,will speed her foot again,led hither by pure love.which of them both is dearest to me i have no skill in sense to make distinction.provide this messenger.my heart is heavy and mine age is weak;grief would have tears,and sorrow bids me speak.nay,come;for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight.they say the french count has done most honourable service.it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander,and that with his own hand he slew the duke\\'s brother.we have lost our labour;they are gone a contrary way : hark ! you may know by their trumpets.come;let\\'s return again,and suffice ourselves with the report of it.well,diana,take heed of this french earl : the honour of a maid is her name,and no legacy is so rich as honesty.i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.i know that knave;hang him ! one parolles : a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl.beware of them,diana;their promises,enticements,oaths,tokens,and all these engines of lust,are not the things they go under : many a maid hath been seduced by them;and the misery is,example,that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood,cannot for all that dissuade succession,but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them.i hope i need not to advise you further;but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are,though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.you shall not need to fear me.i hope so.look,here comes a pilgrim :i know she will lie at my house;thither they send one another.i\\'ll question her.god save you,pilgrim ! whither are you bound ?to saint jaques le grand.where do the palmers lodge,i do beseech you ?at the saint francis,here beside the port.is this the way ?ay,marry,is\\'t.hark you !they come this way.if you will tarry,holy pilgrim,but till the troops come by,i will conduct you where you shall be lodg\\'d :the rather,for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself.is it yourself ?if you shall please so,pilgrim.i thank you,and will stay upon your leisure.you came,i think,from france ?i did so.here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service.his name,i pray you.the count rousillon : know you such a one ?but by the ear,that hears most nobly of him;his face i know not.whatsoe\\'er he is,he\\'s bravely taken here.he stole from france,as \\'tis reported,for the king had married him against his liking.think you it is so ?ay,surely,mere the truth : i know his lady.there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her.what\\'s his name ?monsieur parolles.o ! i believe with him,in argument of praise,or to the worth of the great count himself,she is too mean to have her name repeated : all her deserving is a reserved honesty,and that i have not heard examin\\'d.alas,poor lady !\\'tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord.ay,right;good creature,wheresoe\\'er she is,her heart weighs sadly.this young maid might do her a shrewd turn if she pleas\\'d.how do you mean ?may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose.he does,indeed;and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid :but she is arm\\'d for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence.the gods forbid else !so,now they come.that is antonio,the duke\\'s eldest son;that,escalus.which is the frenchman ?he;that with the plume : \\'tis a most gallant fellow;i would he lov\\'d his wife.if he were honester,he were much goodlier;is\\'t not a handsome gentleman ?i like him well.\\'tis pity he is not honest.yond\\'s that same knave that leads him to these places : were i his lady i would poison that vile rascal.which is he ?that jack-an-apes with scarfs.why is he melancholy ?perchance he\\'s hurt i\\' the battle.lose our drum ! well.he\\'s shrewdly vexed at something.look,he has spied us.marry,hang you !and your courtesy,for a ring-carrier !the troop is past.come,pilgrim,i will bring you where you shall host : of enjoin\\'d penitents there\\'s four or five,to great saint jaques bound,already at my house.i humbly thank you.please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us to-night,the charge and thanking shall be for me;and,to requite you further,i will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note.we\\'ll take your offer kindly.nay,good my lord,put him to\\'t : let him have his way.if your lordship find him not a hilding,hold me no more in your respect.on my life,my lord,a bubble.do you think i am so far deceived in him ?believe it,my lord,in mine own direct knowledge,without any malice,but to speak of him as my kinsman,he\\'s a most notable coward,an infinite and endless liar,an hourly promise-breaker,the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship\\'s entertainment.it were fit you knew him;lest,reposing too far in his virtue,which he hath not,he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.i would i knew in what particular action to try him.none better than to let him fetch off his drum,which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.i,with a troop of florentines,will suddenly surprise him : such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy.we will bind and hood wink him so,that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries,when we bring him to our own tents.be but your lordship present at his examination : if he do not,for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear,offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you,and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath,never trust my judgment in anything.o ! for the love of laughter,let him fetch his drum : he says he has a stratagem for\\'t.when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in\\'t,and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted,if you give him not john drum\\'s entertainment,your inclining cannot be removed.here he comes.o ! for the love of laughter,hinder not the honour of his design : let him fetch off his drum in any hand.how now,monsieur ! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.a pox on\\'t ! let it go : \\'tis but a drum.\\'but a drum !\\' is\\'t \\'but a drum ?\\' a drum so lost ! there was excellent command,to charge in with our horse upon our own wings,and to rend our own soldiers !that was not to be blamed in the command of the service : it was a disaster of war that c sar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command.well,we cannot greatly condemn our success : some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum;but it is not to be recovered.it might have been recovered.it might;but it is not now.it is to be recovered.but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer,i would have that drum or another,or hic jacet.why,if you have a stomach to\\'t,monsieur,if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter,be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on;i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit : if you speed well in it,the duke shall both speak of it,and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.by the hand of a soldier,i will undertake it.but you must not now slumber in it.i\\'ll about it this evening : and i will presently pen down my dilemmas,encourage myself in my certainty,put myself into my mortal preparation,and by midnight look to hear further from me.may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it ?i know not what the success will be,my lord;but the attempt i vow.i know thou\\'rt valiant;and,to the possibility of thy soldiership,will subscribe for thee.farewell.i love not many words.no more than a fish loves water.is not this a strange fellow,my lord,that so confidently seems to undertake this business,which he knows is not to be done;damns himself to do,and dares better be damned than to do\\'t ?you do not know him,my lord,as we do : certain it is,that he will steal himself into a man\\'s favour,and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries;but when you find him out you have him ever after.why,do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto ?none in the world;but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies.but we have almost embossed him,you shall see his fall to-night;for,indeed,he is not for your lordship\\'s respect.we\\'ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu : when his disguise and he is parted,tell me what a sprat you shall find him;which you shall see this very night.i must go look my twigs : he shall be caught.your brother he shall go along with me.as\\'t please your lordship : i\\'ll leave you.now will i lead you to the house,and show you the lass i spoke of.but you say she\\'s honest.that\\'s all the fault.i spoke with her but once,and found her wondrous cold;but i sent to her,by this same coxcomb that we have i\\' the wind,tokens and letters which she did re-send;and this is all i have done.she\\'s a fair creature;will you go see her ?with all my heart,my lord.if you misdoubt me that i am not she,i know not how i shall assure you further,but i shall lose the grounds i work upon.though my estate be fall\\'n,i was well born,nothing acquainted with these businesses;and would not put my reputation now in any staining act.nor would i wish you.first,give me trust,the county is my husband,and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word;and then you cannot,by the good aid that i of you shall borrow,err in bestowing it.i should believe you :for you have show\\'d me that which well approves you\\'re great in fortune.take this purse of gold,and let me buy your friendly help thus far,which i will over-pay and pay again when i have found it.the county woos your daughter,lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,resolv\\'d to carry her : let her in fine consent,as we\\'ll direct her how \\'tis best to bear it.now,his important blood will nought deny that she\\'ll demand : a ring the county wears,that down ward hath succeeded in his house from son to son,some four or five descents since the first father wore it : this ring he holds in most rich choice;yet,in his idle fire,to buy his will,it would not seem too dear,howe\\'er repented after.now i see the bottom of your purpose.you see it lawful then.it is no more,but that your daughter,ere she seems as won,desires this ring,appoints him an encounter,in fine,delivers me to fill the time,herself most chastely absent.after this,to marry her,i\\'ll add three thousand crowns to what is past already.i have yielded.instruct my daughter how she shall persever,that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent.every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs compos\\'d to her unworthiness : it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves,for he persists as if his life lay on\\'t.why then to-night let us assay our plot;which,if it speed,is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,and lawful meaning in a lawful act,where both not sin,and yet a sinful fact.but let\\'s about it.he can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.when you sally upon him,speak what terrible language you will : though you understand it not yourselves,no matter;for we must not seem to understand him,unless some one among us,whom we must produce for an interpreter.good captain,let me be the interpreter.art not acquainted with him ? knows he not thy voice ?no,sir,i warrant you.but what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again ?even such as you speak to me.he must think us some band of strangers i\\' the adversary\\'s entertainment.now,he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages;therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy,not to know what we speak one to another;so we seem to know,is to know straight our purpose : chough\\'s language,gabble enough,and good enough.as for you,interpreter,you must seem very politic.but couch,ho ! here he comes,to beguile two hours in a sleep,and then to return and swear the lies he forges.ten o\\'clock : within these three hours \\'twill be time enough to go home.what shall i say i have done ? it must be a very plausive invention that carries it.they begin to smoke me,and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door.i find my tongue is too foolhardy;but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures,not daring the reports of my tongue.this is the first truth that e\\'er thine own tongue was guilty of.what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum,being not ignorant of the impossibility,and knowing i had no such purpose ? i must give myself some hurts and say i got them in exploit.yet slight ones will not carry it : they will say,\\'came you off with so little ?\\' and great ones i dare not give.wherefore,what\\'s the instance ? tongue,i must put you into a butter-woman\\'s mouth,and buy myself another of bajazet\\'s mute,if you prattle me into these perils.is it possible he should know what he is,and be that he is ?i would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my spanish sword.we cannot afford you so.or the baring of my beard,and to say it was in stratagem.\\'twould not do.or to drown my clothes,and say i was stripped.hardly serve.though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel how deep ?thirty fathom.three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.i would i had any drum of the enemy\\'s :i would swear i recovered it.thou shalt hear one anon.a drum now of the enemy\\'s !throca movousus,cargo,cargo,cargo.cargo,cargo,villianda par corbo,cargo.o ! ransom,ransom ! do not hide mine eyes.boskos thromuldo boskos.i know you are the muskos\\' regiment;and i shall lose my life for want of language.if there be here german,or dane,low dutch,italian,or french,let him speak to me :i will discover that which shall undo the florentine.boskos vauvado :i understand thee,and can speak thy tongue :kerelybonto : sir,betake thee to thy faith,for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.o !o ! pray,pray,pray.manka revania dulche.oscorbidulchos volivorco.the general is content to spare thee yet;and,hoodwink\\'d as thou art,will lead thee on to gather from thee : haply thou may\\'st inform something to save thy life.o ! let me live,and all the secrets of our camp i\\'ll show,their force,their purposes;nay,i\\'ll speak that which you will wonder at.but wilt thou faithfully ?if i do not,damn me.acordo linta.come on;thou art granted space.go,tell the count rousillon,and my brother,we have caught the woodcock,and will keep him muffled till we do hear from them.captain,i will.a\\' will betray us all unto ourselves :inform on that.so i will,sir.till then,i\\'ll keep him dark and safely lock\\'d.they told me that your name was fontibell.no,my good lord,diana.titled goddess;and worth it,with addition ! but,fair soul,in your fine frame hath love no quality ?if the quick fire of youth light not your mind,you are no maiden,but a monument :when you are dead,you should be such a one as you are now,for you are cold and stern;and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got.she then was honest.so should you be.no :my mother did but duty;such,my lord,as you owe to your wife.no more o\\' that !i prithee do not strive against my vows.i was compell\\'d to her;but i love thee by love\\'s own sweet constraint,and will for ever do thee all rights of service.ay,so you serve us till we serve you;but when you have our roses,you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness.how have i sworn !\\'tis not the many oaths that make the truth,but the plain single vow that is vow\\'d true.what is not holy,that we swear not by,but take the highest to witness : then,pray you,tell me,if i should swear by god\\'s great attributes i lov\\'d you dearly,would you believe my oaths,when i did love you ill ? this has no holding,to swear by him whom i protest to love,that i will work against him : therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions,but unseal\\'d;at least in my opinion.change it,change it.be not so holy-cruel : love is holy;and my integrity ne\\'er knew the crafts that you do charge men with.stand no more off,but give thyself unto my sick desires,who then recover : say thou art mine,and ever my love as it begins shall so persever.i see that men make ropes in such a scarr that we\\'ll forsake ourselves.give me that ring.i\\'ll lend it thee,my dear;but have no power to give it from me.will you not,my lord ?it is an honour \\'longing to our house,bequeathed down from many ancestors,which were the greatest obloquy i\\' the world in me to lose.mine honour\\'s such a ring :my chastity\\'s the jewel of our house,bequeathed down from many ancestors,which were the greatest obloquy i\\' the world in me to lose.thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part against your vain assault.here,take my ring :my house,mine honour,yea,my life,be thine,and i\\'ll be bid by thee.when midnight comes,knock at my chamber-window :i\\'ll order take my mother shall not hear.now will i charge you in the band of truth,when you have conquer\\'d my yet maiden bed,remain there but an hour,nor speak to me.my reasons are most strong;and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver\\'d :and on your finger in the night i\\'ll put another ring,that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds.adieu,till then;then,fail not.you have won a wife of me,though there my hope be done.a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee.for which live long to thank both heaven and me !you may so in the end.my mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat in \\'s heart;she says all men have the like oaths : he had sworn to marry me when his wife\\'s dead;therefore i\\'ll lie with him when i am buried.since frenchmen are so braid,marry that will,i live and die a maid :only in this disguise i think\\'t no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win.you have not given him his mother\\'s letter ?i have delivered it an hour since : there is something in\\'t that stings his nature,for on the reading it he changed almost into another man.he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king,who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him.i will tell you a thing,but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.when you have spoken it,\\'tis dead,and i am the grave of it.he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence,of a most chaste renown;and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour : he hath given her his monumental ring,and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.now,god delay our rebellion ! as we are ourselves,what things are we !merely our own traitors : and as in the common course of all treasons,we still see them reveal themselves,till they attain to their abhorred ends,so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility,in his proper stream o\\'erflows himself.is it not most damnable in us,to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents ? we shall not then have his company to-night ?not till after midnight,for he is dieted to his hour.that approaches apace : i would gladly have him see his company anatomized,that he might take a measure of his own judgments,wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.we will not meddle with him till he come,for his presence must be the whip of the other.in the meantime what near you of these wars ?i hear there is an overture of peace.nay,i assure you,a peace concluded.what will count rousillon do then ? will he travel higher,or return again into france ?i perceive by this demand,you are not altogether of his council.let it be forbid,sir;so should i be a great deal of his act.sir,his wife some two months since fled from his house : her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand;which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished;and,there residing,the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief;in fine,made a groan of her last breath,and now she sings in heaven.how is this justified ?the stronger part of it by her own letters,which make her story true,even to the point of her death : her death itself,which could not be her office to say is come,was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place.hath the count all this intelligence ?ay,and the particular confirmations,point from point,to the full arming of the verity.i am heartily sorry that he\\'ll be glad of this.how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses !and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears ! the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.the web of our life is of a mingled yarn,good and ill together : our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not;and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues.how now ! where\\'s your master ?he met the duke in the street,sir,of whom he hath taken a solemn leave : his lordship will next morning for france.the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.they shall be no more than needful there,if they were more than they can commend.they cannot be too sweet for the king\\'s tartness.here\\'s his lordship now.how now,my lord ! is\\'t not after midnight ?i have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses,a month\\'s length a-piece,by an abstract of success : i have conge\\'d with the duke,done my adieu with his nearest,buried a wife,mourned for her,writ to my lady mother i am returning,entertained my convoy;and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs : the last was the greatest,but that i have not ended yet.if the business be of any difficulty,and this morning your departure hence,it requires haste of your lordship.i mean,the business is not ended,as fearing to hear of it hereafter.but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier ? come,bring forth this counterfeit model : he has deceived me,like a double-meaning prophesier.bring him forth.has sat i\\' the stocks all night,poor gallant knave.no matter;his heels have deserved it,in usurping his spurs so long.how does he carry himself ?i have told your lordship already,the stocks carry him.but to answer you as you would be understood;he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk : he hath confessed himself to morgan,whom he supposes to be a friar,from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i\\' the stocks : and what think you he hath confessed ?nothing of me,has a\\' ?his confession is taken,and it shall be read to his face : if your lordship be in\\'t,as i believe you are,you must have the patience to hear it.a plague upon him ! muffled ! he can say nothing of me : hush ! hush !hoodman comes ! porto tartarossa.he calls for the tortures : what will you say without \\'em ?i will confess what i know without constraint : if ye pinch me like a pasty,i can say no more.bosko chimurcho.boblibindo chicurmurco.you are a merciful general.our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note.and truly,as i hope to live.first,demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.what say you to that ?five or six thousand;but very weak and unserviceable : the troops are all scattered,and the commanders very poor rogues,upon my reputation and credit,and as i hope to live.shall i set down your answer so ?do : i\\'ll take the sacrament on\\'t,how and which way you will.all\\'s one to him.what a past-saving slave is this !you are deceived,my lord : this is monsieur parolles,the gallant militarist,that was his own phrase,that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf,and the practice in the chape of his dagger.i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean;nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.well,that\\'s set down.five or six thousand horse,i said,i will say true,or thereabouts,set down,for i\\'ll speak truth.he\\'s very near the truth in this.but i con him no thanks for\\'t,in the nature he delivers it.poor rogues,i pray you,say.well,that\\'s set down.i humbly thank you,sir.a truth\\'s a truth;the rogues are marvellous poor.demand of him,of what strength they are a-foot.what say you to that ?by my troth,sir,if i were to live this present hour,i will tell true.let me see : spurio,a hundred and fifty;sebastian,so many;corambus,so many;jaques,so many;guiltian,cosmo,lodowick,and gratii,two hundred fifty each;mine own company,chitopher,vaumond,bentii,two hundred fifty each : so that the muster-file,rotten and sound,upon my life,amounts not to fifteen thousand poll;half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks,lest they shake themselves to pieces.what shall be done to him ?nothing,but let him have thanks.demand of him my condition,and what credit i have with the duke.well,that\\'s set down.you shall demand of him,whether one captain dumain be i\\' the camp,a frenchman;what his reputation is with the duke;what his valour,honesty,and expertness in wars;or whether he thinks it were not possible,with well-weighing sums of gold,to corrupt him to a revolt.what say you to this ? what do you know of it ?i beseech you,let me answer to the particular of the inter\\'gatories : demand them singly.do you know this captain dumain ?i know him : a\\' was a botcher\\'s \\'prentice in paris,from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve\\'s fool with child;a dumb innocent,that could not say him nay.nay,by your leave,hold your hands;though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.well,is this captain in the duke of florence\\'s camp ?upon my knowledge he is,and lousy.nay,look not so upon me;we shall hear of your lordship anon.what is his reputation with the duke ?the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine,and writ to me this other day to turn him out o\\' the band : i think i have his letter in my pocket.marry,we\\'ll search.in good sadness,i do not know : either it is there,or it is upon a file with the duke\\'s other letters in my tent.here \\'tis;here\\'s a paper;shall i read it to you ?i do not know if it be it or no.our interpreter does it well.excellently.dian,the count\\'s a fool,and full of gold that is not the duke\\'s letter,sir;that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence,one diana,to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon,a foolish idle boy,but for all that very ruttish.i pray you,sir,put it up again.nay,i\\'ll read it first,by your favour.my meaning in\\'t,i protest,was very honest in the behalf of the maid;for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy,who is a whale to virginity,and devours up all the fry it finds.damnable both-sides rogue !when he swears oaths,bid him drop gold,and take it;after he scores,he never pays the score :half won is match well made;match,and well make it;he ne\\'er pays after-debts;take it before,and say a soldier,dian,told thee this,men are to mell with,boys are not to kiss;for count of this,the count\\'s a fool,i know it,who pays before,but not when he does owe it.thine,as he vow\\'d to thee in thine ear,he shall be whipped through the army with this rime in\\'s forehead.this is your devoted friend,sir;the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.i could endure anything before but a cat,and now he\\'s a cat to me.i perceive,sir,by our general\\'s looks,we shall be fain to hang you.my life,sir,in any case ! not that i am afraid to die;but that,my offences being many,i would repent out the remainder of nature.let me live,sir,in a dungeon,i\\' the stocks,or anywhere,so i may live.we\\'ll see what may be done,so you confess freely : therefore,once more to this captain dumain.you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour : what is his honesty ?he will steal,sir,an egg out of a cloister;for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus;he professes not keeping of oaths;in breaking \\'em he is stronger than hercules;he will lie,sir,with such volubility,that you would think truth were a fool;drunkenness is his best virtue,for he will be swine-drunk,and in his sleep he does little harm,save to his bed-clothes about him;but they know his conditions,and lay him in straw.i have but little more to say,sir,of his honesty : he has everything that an honest man should not have;what an honest man should have,he has nothing.i begin to love him for this.for this description of thine honesty ? a pox upon him for me ! he is more and more a cat.what say you to his expertness in war ?faith,sir,he has led the drum before the english tragedians,to belie him i will not,and more of his soldiership i know not;except,in that country,he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile-end,to instruct for the doubling of files : i would do the man what honour i can,but of this i am not certain.he hath out-villained villany so far,that the rarity redeems him.a pox on him ! he\\'s a cat still.his qualities being at this poor price,i need not ask you,if gold will corrupt him to revolt.sir,for a cardecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation,the inheritance of it;and cut the entail from all remainders,and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.what\\'s his brother,the other captain dumain ?why does he ask him or me ?what\\'s he ?e\\'en a crow o\\' the same nest;not altogether so great as the first in goodness,but greater a great deal in evil.he excels his brother for a coward,yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is.in a retreat he out-runs any lackey;marry,in coming on he has the cramp.if your life be saved,will you undertake to betray the florentine ?ay,and the captain of his horse,count rousillon.i\\'ll whisper with the general,and know his pleasure.i\\'ll no more drumming;a plague of all drums ! only to seem to deserve well,and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count,have i run into this danger.yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken ?there is no remedy,sir,but you must die.the general says,you,that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army,and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held,can serve the world for no honest use;therefore you must die.come,headsman,off with his head.o lord,sir,let me live,or let me see my death !that shall you,and take your leave of all your friends.so,look about you : know you any here ?good morrow,noble captain.god bless you,captain parolles.god save you,noble captain.captain,what greeting will you to my lord lafeu ? i am for france.good captain,will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon ? an i were not a very coward i\\'d compel it of you;but fare you well.you are undone,captain;all but your scarf;that has a knot on\\'t yet.who cannot be crushed with a plot ?if you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame,you might begin an impudent nation.fare ye well,sir;i am for france too : we shall speak of you there.yet am i thankful : if my heart were great \\'twould burst at this.captain i\\'ll be no more;but i will eat and drink,and sleep as soft as captain shall : simply the thing i am shall make me live.who knows himself a braggart,let him fear this;for it will come to pass that every braggart shall be found an ass.rust,sword ! cool,blushes ! and parolles,live safest in shame ! being fool\\'d,by foolery thrive !there\\'s place and means for every man alive.i\\'ll after them.that you may well perceive i have not wrong\\'d you,one of the greatest in the christian world shall be my surety;\\'fore whose throne \\'tis needful,ere i can perfect mine intents,to kneel.time was i did him a desired office,dear almost as his life;which gratitude through flinty tartar\\'s bosom would peep forth,and answer,thanks.i duly am inform\\'d his grace is at marseilles;to which place we have convenient convoy.you must know,i am supposed dead : the army breaking,my husband hies him home;where,heaven aiding,and by the leave of my good lord the king,we\\'ll be before our welcome.gentle madam,you never had a servant to whose trust your business was more welcome.nor you,mistress,ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour to recompense your love.doubt not but heaven hath brought me up to be your daughter\\'s dower,as it hath fated her to be my motive and helper to a husband.but,o strange men !that can such sweet use make of what they hate,when saucy trusting of the cozen\\'d thoughts defiles the pitchy night : so lust doth play with what it loathes for that which is away.but more of this hereafter.you,diana,under my poor instructions yet must suffer something in my behalf.let death and honesty go with your impositions,i am yours upon your will to suffer.yet,i pray you :but with the word the time will bring on summer,when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,and be as sweet as sharp.we must away;our waggon is prepar\\'d,and time revives us :all\\'s well that ends well : still the fine\\'s the crown;whate\\'er the course,the end is the renown.no,no,no;your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there,whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour : your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour,and your son here at home,more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee i speak of.i would i had not known him;it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating.if she had partaken of my flesh,and cost me the dearest groans of a mother,i could not have owed her a more rooted love.\\'twas a good lady,\\'twas a good lady : we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.indeed,sir,she was the sweet-marjoram of the salad,or,rather the herb of grace.they are not salad-herbs,you knave;they are nose-herbs.i am no great nebuchadnezzar,sir;i have not much skill in grass.whether dost thou profess thyself,a knave,or a fool ?a fool,sir,at a woman\\'s service,and a knave at a man\\'s.your distinction ?i would cozen the man of his wife,and do his service.so you were a knave at his service,indeed.and i would give his wife my bauble,sir,to do her service.i will subscribe for thee,thou art both knave and fool.at your service.no,no,no.why,sir,if i cannot serve you,i can serve as great a prince as you are.who\\'s that ? a frenchman ?faith,sir,a\\' has an english name;but his phisnomy is more hotter in france than there.what prince is that ?the black prince,sir;alias,the prince of darkness;alias,the devil.hold thee,there\\'s my purse.i give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of : serve him still.i am a woodland fellow,sir,that always loved a great fire;and the master i speak of,ever keeps a good fire.but,sure,he is the prince of the world;let his nobility remain in\\'s court.i am for the house with the narrow gate,which i take to be too little for pomp to enter : some that humble themselves may;but the many will be too chill and tender,and they\\'ll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.go thy ways,i begin to be aweary of thee;and i tell thee so before,because i would not fall out with thee.go thy ways : let my horses be well looked to,without any tricks.if i put any tricks upon \\'em,sir,they shall be jade\\'s tricks,which are their own right by the law of nature.a shrewd knave and an unhappy.so he is.my lord that\\'s gone made himself much sport out of him : by his authority he remains here,which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness;and,indeed,he has no pace,but runs where he will.i like him well;\\'tis not amiss.and i was about to tell you,since i heard of the good lady\\'s death,and that my lord your son was upon his return home,i moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter;which,in the minority of them both,his majesty,out of a self-gracious remembrance,did first propose.his highness hath promised me to do it;and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son,there is no fitter matter.how does your ladyship like it ?with very much content,my lord;and i wish it happily effected.his highness comes post from marseilles,of as able body as when he numbered thirty : he will be here to-morrow,or i am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed.it rejoices me that i hope i shall see him ere i die.i have letters that my son will be here to-night : i shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together.madam,i was thinking with what manners i might safely be admitted.you need but plead your honourable privilege.lady,of that i have made a bold charter;but i thank my god it holds yet.o madam ! yonder\\'s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on\\'s face : whether there be a scar under it or no,the velvet knows;but \\'tis a goodly patch of velvet.his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half,but his right cheek is worn bare.a scar nobly got,or a noble scar,is a good livery of honour;so belike is that.but it is your carbonadoed face.let us go see your son,i pray you : i long to talk with the young noble soldier.faith,there\\'s a dozen of \\'em,with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers,which bow the head and nod at every man.but this exceeding posting,day and night,must wear your spirits low;we cannot help it :but since you have made the days and nights as one,to wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,be bold you do so grow in my requital as nothing can unroot you.in happy time;this man may help me to his majesty\\'s ear,if he would spend his power.god save you,sir.and you.sir,i have seen you in the court of france.i have been sometimes there.i do presume,sir,that you are not fallen from the report that goes upon your goodness;and therefore,goaded with most sharp occasions,which lay nice manners by,i put you to the use of your own virtues,for the which i shall continue thankful.what\\'s your will ?that it will please you to give this poor petition to the king,and aid me with that store of power you have to come into his presence.the king\\'s not here.not here,sir !not,indeed :he hence remov\\'d last night,and with more haste than is his use.lord,how we lose our pains !all\\'s well that ends well yet,though time seems so adverse and means unfit.i do beseech you,whither is he gone ?marry,as i take it,to rousillon;whither i am going.i do beseech you,sir,since you are like to see the king before me,commend the paper to his gracious hand;which i presume shall render you no blame but rather make you thank your pains for it.i will come after you with what good speed our means will make us means.this i\\'ll do for you.and you shall find yourself to be well thank\\'d,whate\\'er falls more.we must to horse again :go,go,provide.good monsieur lavache,give my lord lafeu this letter.i have ere now,sir,been better known to you,when i have held familiarity with fresher clothes;but i am now,sir,muddied in fortune\\'s mood,and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.truly,fortune\\'s displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of : i will henceforth eat no fish of fortune\\'s buttering.prithee,allow the wind.nay,you need not to stop your nose,sir : i spake but by a metaphor.indeed,sir,if your metaphor stink,i will stop my nose;or against any man\\'s metaphor.prithee,get thee further.pray you,sir,deliver me this paper.foh ! prithee,stand away : a paper from fortune\\'s close-stool to give to a nobleman ! look,here he comes himself.here is a purr of fortune\\'s,sir,or of fortune\\'s cat but not a musk-cat that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure,and,as he says,is muddied withal.pray you,sir,use the carp as you may,for he looks like a poor,decayed,ingenious,foolish,rascally knave.i do pity his distress in my similes of comfort,and leave him to your lordship.my lord,i am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.and what would you have me to do ? \\'tis too late to pare her nails now.wherein have you played the knave with fortune that she should scratch you,who of herself is a good lady,and would not have knaves thrive long under her ? there\\'s a cardecu for you.let the justices make you and fortune friends;i am for other business.i beseech your honour to hear me one single word.you beg a single penny more : come,you shall ha\\'t;save your word.my name,my good lord,is parolles.you beg more than one word then.cox my passion ! give me your hand.how does your drum ?o,my good lord ! you were the first that found me.was i,in sooth ? and i was the first that lost thee.it lies in you,my lord,to bring me in some grace,for you did bring me out.out upon thee,knave ! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of god and the devil ? one brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out.the king\\'s coming;i know by his trumpets.sirrah,inquire further after me;i had talk of you last night : though you are a fool and a knave,you shall eat : go to,follow.i praise god for you.we lost a jewel of her,and our esteem was made much poorer by it : but your son,as mad in folly,lack\\'d the sense to know her estimation home.\\'tis past,my liege;and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion,done i\\' the blaze of youth;when oil and fire,too strong for reason\\'s force,o\\'erbears it and burns on.my honour\\'d lady,i have forgiven and forgotten all,though my revenges were high bent upon him,and watch\\'d the time to shoot.this i must say,but first i beg my pardon,the young lord did to his majesty,his mother,and his lady,offence of mighty note,but to himself the greatest wrong of all : he lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes,whose words all ears took captive,whose dear perfection hearts that scorn\\'d to serve humbly call\\'d mistress.praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear.well,call him hither;we are reconcil\\'d,and the first view shall kill all repetition.let him not ask our pardon :the nature of his great offence is dead,and deeper than oblivion we do bury the incensing relics of it : let him approach,a stranger,no offender;and inform him so \\'tis our will he should.i shall,my liege.what says he to your daughter ? have you spoke ?all that he is hath reference to your highness.then shall we have a match.i have letters sent me,that set him high in fame.he looks well on\\'t.i am not a day of season,for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once;but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way : so stand thou forth;the time is fair again.my high-repented blames,dear sovereign,pardon to me.all is whole;not one word more of the consumed time.let\\'s take the instant by the forward top,for we are old,and on our quick\\'st decrees the inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them.you remember the daughter of this lord ?admiringly,my liege :at first i stuck my choice upon her,ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue,where the impression of mine eye infixing,contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,which warp\\'d the line of every other favour;scorn\\'d a fair colour,or express\\'d it stolen;extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object : thence it came that she,whom all men prais\\'d,and whom myself,since i have lost,have lov\\'d,was in mine eye the dust that did offend it.well excus\\'d :that thou didst love her,strikes some scores away from the great compt.but love that comes too late,like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,to the great sender turns a sour offence,crying,\\'that\\'s good that\\'s gone.\\' our rasher faults make trivial price of serious things we have,not knowing them until we know their grave :oft our displeasures,to ourselves unjust,destroy our friends and after weep their dust :our own love waking cries to see what\\'s done,while shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.be this sweet helen\\'s knell,and now forget her.send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin :the main consents are had;and here we\\'ll stay to see our widower\\'s second marriage-day.which better than the first,o dear heaven,bless !or,ere they meet,in me,o nature,cesse !come on,my son,in whom my house\\'s name must be digested,give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,that she may quickly come.and every hair that\\'s on\\'t,helen,that\\'s dead,was a sweet creature;such a ring as this,the last that e\\'er i took her leave at court,i saw upon her finger.hers it was not.now,pray you,let me see it;for mine eye,while i was speaking,oft was fasten\\'d to\\'t.this ring was mine;and,when i gave it helen,i bade her,if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help,that by this token i would relieve her.had you that craft to reave her of what should stead her most ?my gracious sovereign,howe\\'er it pleases you to take it so,the ring was never hers.son,on my life,i have seen her wear it;and she reckon\\'d it at her life\\'s rate.i am sure i saw her wear it.you are deceiv\\'d,my lord,she never saw it :in florence was it from a casement thrown me,wrapp\\'d in a paper,which contain\\'d the name of her that threw it.noble she was,and thought i stood engag\\'d : but when i had subscrib\\'d to mine own fortune,and inform\\'d her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture,she ceas\\'d,in heavy satisfaction,and would never receive the ring again.plutus himself,that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,hath not in nature\\'s mystery more science than i have in this ring : \\'twas mine,\\'twas helen\\'s,whoever gave it you.then,if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself,confess \\'twas hers,and by what rough enforcement you got it from her.she call\\'d the saints to surety,that she would never put it from her finger unless she gave it to yourself in bed,where you have never come,or sent it us upon her great disaster.she never saw it.thou speak\\'st it falsely,as i love mine honour;and mak\\'st conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out.if it should prove that thou art so inhuman,\\'twill not prove so;and yet i know not : thou didst hate her deadly,and she is dead;which nothing,but to close her eyes myself,could win me to believe,more than to see this ring.take him away.my fore-past proofs,howe\\'er the matter fall,shall tax my fears of little vanity,having vainly fear\\'d too little.away with him !we\\'ll sift this matter further.if you shall prove this ring was ever hers,you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence,where yet she never was.i am wrapp\\'d in dismal thinkings.gracious sovereign,whether i have been to blame or no,i know not :here\\'s a petition from a florentine,who hath,for four or five removes come short to tender it herself.i undertook it,vanquish\\'d thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant,who by this i know is here attending : her business looks in her with an importing visage,and she told me,in a sweet verbal brief,it did concern your highness with herself.\"upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead,i blush to say it,he won me.now is the count rousillon a widower : his vows are forfeited to me,and my honour\\'s paid to him.he stole from florence,taking no leave,and i follow him to his country for justice.grant it me,o king ! in you it best lies;otherwise a seducer flourishes,and a poor maid is undone.diana capilet.\"i will buy me a son-in-law in a fair,and toll for this : i\\'ll none of him.the heavens have thought well on thee,lafeu,to bring forth this discovery.seek these suitors :go speedily and bring again the count.i am afeard the life of helen,lady,was foully snatch\\'d.now,justice on the doers !i wonder,sir,sith wives are monsters to you,and that you fly them as you swear them lordship,yet you desire to marry.what woman\\'s that ?i am,my lord,a wretched florentine,derived from the ancient capilet :my suit,as i do understand,you know,and therefore know how far i may be pitied.i am her mother,sir,whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring,and both shall cease,without your remedy.come hither,county;do you know these women ?my lord,i neither can nor will deny but that i know them : do they charge me further ?why do you look so strange upon your wife ?she\\'s none of mine,my lord.if you shall marry,you give away this hand,and that is mine;you give away heaven\\'s vows,and those are mine;you give away myself,which is known mine;for i by vow am so embodied yours that she which marries you must marry me;either both or none.your reputation comes too short for my daughter : you are no husband for her.my lord,this is a fond and desperate creature,whom sometime i have laugh\\'d with : let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here.sir,for my thoughts,you have them ill to friend,till your deeds gain them : fairer prove your honour,than in my thought it lies.good my lord,ask him upon his oath,if he does think he had not my virginity.what sayst thou to her ?she\\'s impudent,my lord;and was a common gamester to the camp.he does me wrong,my lord;if i were so,he might have bought me at a common price :do not believe him.o ! behold this ring,whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel;yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o\\' the camp,if i be one.he blushes,and \\'tis it :of six preceding ancestors,that gem conferr\\'d by testament to the sequent issue,hath it been ow\\'d and worn.this is his wife :that ring\\'s a thousand proofs.methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it.i did,my lord,but loath am to produce so bad an instrument : his name\\'s parolles.i saw the man to-day,if man he be.find him,and bring him hither.what of him ?he\\'s quoted for a most perfidious slave,with all the spots of the world tax\\'d and debosh\\'d,whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.am i or that or this for what he\\'ll utter,that will speak anything ?she hath that ring of yours.i think she has : certain it is i lik\\'d her,and boarded her i\\' the wanton way of youth.she knew her distance and did angle for me,madding my eagerness with her restraint,as all impediments in fancy\\'s course are motives of more fancy;and,in fine,her infinite cunning,with her modern grace,subdued me to her rate;she got the ring,and i had that which any inferior might at market-price have bought.i must be patient;you,that have turn\\'d off a first so noble wife,may justly diet me.i pray you yet,since you lack virtue i will lose a husband,send for your ring;i will return it home,and give me mine again.i have it not.what ring was yours,i pray you ?sir,much like the same upon your finger.know you this ring ? this ring was his of late.and this was it i gave him,being a-bed.the story then goes false you threw it him out of a casement.i have spoke the truth.my lord,i do confess the ring was hers.you boggle shrewdly,every feather starts you.is this the man you speak of ?ay,my lord.tell me,sirrah,but tell me true,i charge you,not fearing the displeasure of your master,which,on your just proceeding i\\'ll keep off,by him and by this woman here what know you ?so please your majesty,my master hath been an honourable gentleman : tricks he hath had in him,which gentlemen have.come,come,to the purpose : did he love this woman ?faith,sir,he did love her;but how ?how,i pray you ?he did love her,sir,as a gentleman loves a woman.how is that ?he loved her,sir,and loved her not.as thou art a knave,and no knave.what an equivocal companion is this !i am a poor man,and at your majesty\\'s command.he is a good drum,my lord,but a naughty orator.do you know he promised me marriage ?faith,i know more than i\\'ll speak.but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest ?yes,so please your majesty.i did go between them,as i said;but more than that,he loved her,for,indeed,he was mad for her,and talked of satan,and of limbo,and of furies,and i know not what : yet i was in that credit with them at that time,that i knew of their going to bed,and of other motions,as promising her marriage,and things which would derive me ill will to speak of : therefore i will not speak what i know.thou hast spoken all already,unless thou canst say they are married : but thou art too fine in thy evidence;therefore stand aside.this ring,you say,was yours ?ay,my good lord.where did you buy it ? or who gave it you ?it was not given me,nor i did not buy it.who lent it you ?it was not lent me neither.where did you find it,then ?i found it not.if it were yours by none of all these ways,how could you give it him ?i never gave it him.this woman\\'s an easy glove,my lord : she goes off and on at pleasure.this ring was mine : i gave it his first wife.it might be yours or hers,for aught i know.take her away;i do not like her now.to prison with her;and away with him.unless thou tell\\'st me where thou hadst this ring thou diest within this hour.i\\'ll never tell you.take her away.i\\'ll put in bail,my liege.i think thee now some common customer.by jove,if ever i knew man,\\'twas you.wherefore hast thou accus\\'d him all this while ?because he\\'s guilty,and he is not guilty.he knows i am no maid,and he\\'ll swear to\\'t;i\\'ll swear i am a maid,and he knows not.great king,i am no strumpet,by my life;i am either maid,or else this old man\\'s wife.she does abuse our ears : to prison with her !good mother,fetch my bail.stay,royal sir;the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,and he shall surety me.but for this lord,who hath abus\\'d me,as he knows himself,though yet he never harm\\'d me,here i quit him :he knows himself my bed he hath defil\\'d,and at that time he got his wife with child :dead though she be,she feels her young one kick :so there\\'s my riddle : one that\\'s dead is quick;and now behold the meaning.is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes ?is\\'t real that i see ?no,my good lord;\\'tis but the shadow of a wife you see;the name and not the thing.both,both.o ! pardon.o my good lord ! when i was like this maid,i found you wondrous kind.there is your ring;and,look you,here\\'s your letter;this it says :when from my finger you can get this ring,and are by me with child,&c.this is done :will you be mine,now you are doubly won ?if she,my liege,can make me know this clearly,i\\'ll love her dearly,ever,ever dearly.if it appear not plain,and prove untrue,deadly divorce step between me and you !o ! my dear mother;do i see you living ?mine eyes smell onions;i shall weep anon.good tom drum,lend me a handkercher : so,i thank thee.wait on me home,i\\'ll make sport with thee : let thy curtsies alone,they are scurvy ones.let us from point to point this story know,to make the even truth in pleasure flow.if thou be\\'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,choose thou thy husband,and i\\'ll pay thy dower;for i can guess that by thy honest aid thou keptst a wife herself,thyself a maid.of that,and all the progress,more and less,resolvedly more leisure shall express :all yet seems well;and if it end so meet,the bitter past,more welcome is the sweet.spoken by the the king\\'s a beggar,now the play is done :all is well ended if this suit be won that you express content;which we will pay,with strife to please you,day exceeding day :ours be your patience then,and yours our parts;your gentle hands lend us,and take our hearts.as you like itas i remember,adam,it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,and,as thou sayest,charged my brother on his blessing,to breed me well : and there begins my sadness.my brother jaques he keeps at school,and report speaks goldenly of his profit : for my part,he keeps me rustically at home,or,to speak more properly,stays me here at home unkept;for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth,that differs not from the stalling of an ox ? his horses are bred better;for,besides that they are fair with their feeding,they are taught their manage,and to that end riders dearly hired : but i,his brother,gain nothing under him but growth,for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i.besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me,the something that nature gave me,his countenance seems to take from me : he lets me feed with his hinds,bars me the place of a brother,and,as much as in him lies,mines my gentility with my education.this is it,adam,that grieves me;and the spirit of my father,which i think is within me,begins to mutiny against this servitude.i will no longer endure it,though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it.yonder comes my master,your brother.go apart,adam,and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.now,sir ! what make you here ?nothing : i am not taught to make anything.what mar you then,sir ?marry,sir,i am helping you to mar that which god made,a poor unworthy brother of yours,with idleness.marry,sir,be better employed,and be naught awhile.shall i keep your hogs,and eat husks with them ? what prodigal portion have i spent,that i should come to such penury ?know you where you are,sir ?o ! sir,very well : here in your orchard.know you before whom,sir ?ay,better than he i am before knows me.i know you are my eldest brother;and,in the gentle condition of blood,you should so know me.the courtesy of nations allows you my better,in that you are the first-born;but the same tradition takes not away my blood,were there twenty brothers betwixt us.i have as much of my father in me as you;albeit,i confess,your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.what,boy !come,come,elder brother,you are too young in this.wilt thou lay hands on me,villain ?i am no villain;i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys;he was my father,and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains.wert thou not my brother,i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so : thou hast railed on thyself.sweet masters,be patient : for your father\\'s remembrance,be at accord.let me go,i say.i will not,till i please : you shall hear me.my father charged you in his will to give me good education : you have trained me like a peasant,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities.the spirit of my father grows strong in me,and i will no longer endure it;therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman,or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament;with that i will go buy my fortunes.and what wilt thou do ? beg,when that is spent ? well,sir,get you in : i will not long be troubled with you;you shall have some part of your will : i pray you,leave me.i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.get you with him,you old dog.is \\'old dog\\' my reward ? most true,i have lost my teeth in your service.god be with my old master ! he would not have spoke such a word.is it even so ? begin you to grow upon me ? i will physic your rankness,and yet give no thousand crowns neither.holla,dennis !calls your worship ?was not charles the duke\\'s wrestler here to speak with me ?so please you,he is here at the door,and importunes access to you.call him in.\\'twill be a good way;and to-morrow the wrestling is.good morrow to your worship.good monsieur charles,what\\'s the new news at the new court ?there\\'s no news at the court,sir,but the old news : that is,the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke;and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;therefore he gives them good leave to wander.can you tell if rosalind,the duke\\'s daughter,be banished with her father ?o,no;for the duke\\'s daughter,her cousin,so loves her,being ever from their cradles bred together,that she would have followed her exile,or have died to stay behind her.she is at the court,and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter;and never two ladies loved as they do.where will the old duke live ?they say he is already in the forest of arden,and a many merry men with him;and there they live like the old robin hood of england.they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,and fleet the time carelessly,as they did in the golden world.what,you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke ?marry,do i,sir;and i came to acquaint you with a matter.i am given,sir,secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.to-morrow,sir,i wrestle for my credit,and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.your brother is but young and tender;and,for your love,i would be loath to foil him as i must,for my own honour,if he come in : therefore,out of my love to you,i came hither to acquaint you withal,that either you might stay him from his intendment,or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into,in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.charles,i thank thee for thy love to me,which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite.i had myself notice of my brother\\'s purpose herein,and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it,but he is resolute.i\\'ll tell thee,charles,it is the stubbornest young fellow of france;full of ambition,an envious emulator of every man\\'s good parts,a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother : therefore use thy discretion.i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.and thou wert best look to\\'t;for if thou dost him any slight disgrace,or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee,he will practise against thee by poison,entrap thee by some treacherous device,and never leave thee till he hath ta\\'en thy life by some indirect means or other;for,i assure thee,and almost with tears i speak it,there is not one so young and so villanous this day living.i speak but brotherly of him;but should i anatomize him to thee as he is,i must blush and weep,and thou must look pale and wonder.i am heartily glad i came hither to you.if he come to-morrow,i\\'ll give him his payment : if ever he go alone again,i\\'ll never wrestle for prize more;and so god keep your worship !farewell,good charles.now will i stir this gamester.i hope i shall see an end of him;for my soul,yet i know not why,hates nothing more than he.yet he\\'s gentle,never schooled and yet learned,full of noble device,of all sorts enchantingly beloved,and,indeed so much in the heart of the world,and especially of my own people,who best know him,that i am altogether misprised.but it shall not be so long;this wrestler shall clear all : nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither,which now i\\'ll go about.i pray thee,rosalind,sweet my coz,be merry.dear celia,i show more mirth than i am mistress of,and would you yet i were merrier ? unless you could teach me to forget a banished father,you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight that i love thee.if my uncle,thy banished father,had banished thy uncle,the duke my father,so thou hadst been still with me,i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine : so wouldst thou,if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.well,i will forget the condition of my estate,to rejoice in yours.you know my father hath no child but i,nor none is like to have;and,truly,when he dies,thou shalt be his heir : for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce,i will render thee again in affection;by mine honour,i will;and when i break that oath,let me turn monster.therefore,my sweet rose,my dear rose,be merry.from henceforth i will,coz,and devise sports.let me see;what think you of falling in love ?marry,i prithee,do,to make sport withal : but love no man in good earnest;nor no further in sport neither,than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.what shall be our sport then ?let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel,that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.i would we could do so,for her benefits are mightily misplaced,and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.\\'tis true;for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest,and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.nay,now thou goest from fortune\\'s office to nature\\'s : fortune reigns in gifts of the world,not in the lineaments of nature.no ? when nature hath made a fair creature,may she not by fortune fall into the fire ? though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune,hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?indeed,there is fortune too hard for nature,when fortune makes nature\\'s natural the cutter-off of nature\\'s wit.peradventure this is not fortune\\'s work neither,but nature\\'s;who,perceiving our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses,hath sent this natural for our whetstone : for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.how now,wit ! whither wander you ?mistress,you must come away to your father.were you made the messenger ?no,by mine honour;but i was bid to come for you.where learned you that oath,fool ?of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes,and swore by his honour the mustard was naught : now,i\\'ll stand to it,the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good,and yet was not the knight forsworn.how prove you that,in the great heap of your knowledge ?ay,marry : now unmuzzle your wisdom.stand you both forth now : stroke your chins,and swear by your beards that i am a knave.by our beards,if we had them,thou art.by my knavery,if i had it,then i were;but if you swear by that that is not,you are not forsworn : no more was this knight,swearing by his honour,for he never had any;or if he had,he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.prithee,who is\\'t that thou meanest ?one that old frederick,your father,loves.my father\\'s love is enough to honour him.enough ! speak no more of him;you\\'ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.the more pity,that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.by my troth,thou sayest true;for since the little wit that fools have was silenced,the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show.here comes monsieur le beau.with his mouth full of news.which he will put on us,as pigeons feed their young.then we shall be news-cramm\\'d.all the better;we shall be more marketable.bon jour,monsieur le beau : what\\'s the news ?fair princess,you have lost much good sport.sport ! of what colour ?what colour,madam ! how shall i answer you ?as wit and fortune will.or as the destinies decree.well said : that was laid on with a trowel.nay,if i keep not my rank,thou losest thy old smell.you amaze me,ladies : i would have told you of good wrestling,which you have lost the sight of.yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.i will tell you the beginning;and,if it please your ladyships,you may see the end,for the best is yet to do;and here,where you are,they are coming to perform it.well,the beginning,that is dead and buried.there comes an old man and his three sons,i could match this beginning with an old tale.three proper young men,of excellent growth and presence;with bills on their necks,\\'be it known unto all men by these presents.\\' the eldest of the three wrestled with charles,the duke\\'s wrestler;which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs,that there is little hope of life in him : so he served the second,and so the third.yonder they lie;the poor old man,their father,making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.alas !but what is the sport,monsieur,that the ladies have lost ?why,this that i speak of.thus men may grow wiser every day : it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.or i,i promise thee.but is there any else longs to feel this broken music in his sides ? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking ? shall we see this wrestling,cousin ?you must,if you stay here;for here is the place appointed for the wrestling,and they are ready to perform it.yonder,sure,they are coming : let us now stay and see it.come on : since the youth will not be entreated,his own peril on his forwardness.is yonder the man ?even he,madam.alas ! he is too young : yet he looks successfully.how now,daughter and cousin ! are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?ay,my liege,so please you give us leave.you will take little delight in it,i can tell you,there is such odds in the man : in pity of the challenger\\'s youth i would fam dissuade him,but he will not be entreated.speak to him,ladies;see if you can move him.call him hither,good monsieur le beau.do so : i\\'ll not be by.monsieur the challenger,the princes call for you.i attend them with all respect and duty.young man,have you challenged charles the wrestler ?no,fair princess;he is the general challenger : i come but in,as others do,to try with him the strength of my youth.young gentleman,your spirits are too bold for your years.you have seen cruel proof of this man\\'s strength : if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment,the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.we pray you,for your own sake,to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.do,young sir : your reputation shall not therefore be misprised.we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward.i beseech you,punish me not with your hard thoughts,wherein i confess me much guilty,to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything.but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial : wherein if i be foiled,there is but one shamed that was never gracious;if killed,but one dead that is willing to be so.i shall do my friends no wrong,for i have none to lament me;the world no injury,for in it i have nothing;only in the world i fill up a place,which may be better supplied when i have made it empty.the little strength that i have,i would it were with you.and mine,to eke out hers.fare you well.pray heaven i be deceived in you !your heart\\'s desires be with you !come,where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ?ready,sir;but his will hath in it a more modest working.you shall try but one fall.no,i warrant your grace,you shall not entreat him to a second,that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.you mean to mock me after;you should not have mocked me before : but come your ways.now hercules be thy speed,young man !i would i were invisible,to catch the strong fellow by the leg.o excellent young man !if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye,i can tell who should down.no more,no more.yes,i beseech your grace : i am not yet well breathed.how dost thou,charles ?he cannot speak,my lord.bear him away.what is thy name,young man ?orlando,my liege;the youngest son of sir rowland de boys.i would thou hadst been son to some man else :the world esteem\\'d thy father honourable,but i did find him still mine enemy :thou shouldst have better pleas\\'d me with this deed,hadst thou descended from another house.but fare thee well;thou art a gallant youth :i would thou hadst told me of another father.were i my father,coz,would i do this ?i am more proud to be sir rowland\\'s son,his youngest son;and would not change that calling,to be adopted heir to frederick.my father lov\\'d sir rowland as his soul,and all the world was of my father\\'s mind :had i before known this young man his son,i should have given him tears unto entreaties,ere he should thus have ventur\\'d.gentle cousin,let us go thank him and encourage him :my father\\'s rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart.sir,you have well deserv\\'d :if you do keep your promises in love but justly,as you have exceeded all promise,your mistress shall be happy.gentleman,wear this for me,one out of suits with fortune,that could give more,but that her hand lacks means.shall we go,coz ?ay.fare you well,fair gentleman.can i not say,i thank you ? my better parts are all thrown down,and that which here stands up is but a quintain,a mere lifeless block.he calls us back : my pride fell with my fortunes;i\\'ll ask him what he would.did you call,sir ?sir,you have wrestled well,and overthrown more than your enemies.will you go,coz ?have with you.fare you well.what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?i cannot speak to her,yet she urg\\'d conference.o poor orlando,thou art overthrown !or charles or something weaker masters thee.good sir,i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place.albeit you have deserv\\'d high commendation,true applause and love,yet such is now the duke\\'s condition that he misconstrues all that you have done.the duke is humorous : what he is indeed,more suits you to conceive than i to speak of.i thank you,sir;and pray you,tell me this;which of the two was daughter of the duke,that here was at the wrestling ?neither his daughter,if we judge by manners :but yet,indeed the smaller is his daughter :the other is daughter to the banish\\'d duke,and here detain\\'d by her usurping uncle,to keep his daughter company;whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.but i can tell you that of late this duke hath ta\\'en displeasure \\'gainst his gentle niece,grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues,and pity her for her good father\\'s sake;and,on my life,his malice \\'gainst the lady will suddenly break forth.sir,fare you well :hereafter,in a better world than this,i shall desire more love and knowledge of you.i rest much bounden to you : fare you well.thus must i from the smoke into the smother;from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.but heavenly rosalind !why,cousin ! why,rosalind ! cupid have mercy ! not a word ?not one to throw at a dog.no,thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;throw some of them at me;come,lame me with reasons.then there were two cousins laid up;when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.but is all this for your father ?no,some of it is for my child\\'s father :o,how full of briers is this working-day world !they are but burrs,cousin,thrown upon thee in holiday foolery : if we walk not in the trodden paths,our very petticoats will catch them.i could shake them off my coat : these burrs are in my heart.hem them away.i would try,if i could cry \\'hem,\\' and have him.come,come;wrestle with thy affections.o ! they take the part of a better wrestler than myself !o,a good wish upon you ! you will try in time,in despite of a fall.but,turning these jests out of service,let us talk in good earnest : is it possible,on such a sudden,you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland\\'s youngest son ?the duke my father loved his father dearly.doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ? by this kind of chase,i should hate him,for my father hated his father dearly;yet i hate not orlando.no,faith,hate him not,for my sake.why should i not ? doth he not deserve well ?let me love him for that;and do you love him,because i do.look,here comes the duke.with his eyes full of anger.mistress,dispatch you with your safest haste,and get you from our court.me,uncle ?you,cousin :within these ten days if that thou be\\'st found so near our public court as twenty miles,thou diest for it.i do beseech your grace,let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.if with myself i hold intelligence,or have acquaintance with mine own desires,if that i do not dream or be not frantic,as i do trust i am not,then,dear uncle,never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness.thus do all traitors :if their purgation did consist in words,they are as innocent as grace itself :let it suffice thee that i trust thee not.yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor :tell me whereon the likelihood depends.thou art thy father\\'s daughter;there\\'s enough.so was i when your highness took his dukedom;so was i when your highness banish\\'d him.treason is not inherited,my lord;or,if we did derive it from our friends,what\\'s that to me ? my father was no traitor :then,good my liege,mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous.dear sovereign,hear me speak.ay,celia;we stay\\'d her for your sake;else had she with her father rang\\'d along.i did not then entreat to have her stay :it was your pleasure and your own remorse.i was too young that time to value her;but now i know her : if she be a traitor,why so am i;we still have slept together,rose at an instant,learn\\'d,play\\'d,eat together;and wheresoe\\'er we went,like juno\\'s swans,still we went coupled and inseparable.she is too subtle for thee;and her smoothness,her very silence and her patience,speak to the people,and they pity her.thou art a fool : she robs thee of thy name;and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone.then open not thy lips :firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have pass\\'d upon her;she is banish\\'d.pronounce that sentence then,on me,my liege :i cannot live out of her company.you are a fool.you,niece,provide yourself :if you outstay the time,upon mine honour,and in the greatness of my word,you die.o my poor rosalind ! whither wilt thou go ?wilt thou change fathers ? i will give thee mine.i charge thee,be not thou more griev\\'d than i am.i have more cause.thou hast not,cousin;prithee,be cheerful;know\\'st thou not,the duke hath banish\\'d me,his daughter ?that he hath not.no,hath not ? rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one :shall we be sunder\\'d ? shall we part,sweet girl ?no : let my father seek another heir.therefore devise with me how we may fly,whither to go,and what to bear with us :and do not seek to take your change upon you,to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;for,by this heaven,now at our sorrows pale,say what thou canst,i\\'ll go along with thee.why,whither shall we go ?to seek my uncle in the forest of arden.alas,what danger will it be to us,maids as we are,to travel forth so far !beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.i\\'ll put myself in poor and mean attire,and with a kind of umber smirch my face;the like do you : so shall we pass along and never stir assailants.were it not better,because that i am more than common tall,that i did suit me all points like a man ?a gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,a boar-spear in my hand;and,in my heart lie there what hidden woman\\'s fear there will,we\\'ll have a swashing and a martial outside,as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances.what shall i call thee when thou art a man ?i\\'ll have no worse a name than jove\\'s own page,and therefore look you call me ganymede.but what will you be call\\'d ?something that hath a reference to my state :no longer celia,but aliena.but,cousin,what if we assay\\'d to steal the clownish fool out of your father\\'s court ?would he not be a comfort to our travel ?he\\'ll go along o\\'er the wide world with me;leave me alone to woo him.let\\'s away,and get our jewels and our wealth together,devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight.now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment.now,my co-mates and brothers in exile,hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp ? are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court ?here feel we but the penalty of adam,the seasons\\' difference;as,the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter\\'s wind,which,when it bites and blows upon my body,even till i shrink with cold,i smile and say \\'this is no flattery : these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am.\\' sweet are the uses of adversity,which like the toad,ugly and venomous,wears yet a precious jewel in his head;and this our life exempt from public haunt,finds tongues in trees,books in the running brooks,sermons in stones,and good in every thing.i would not change it.happy is your grace,that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style.come,shall we go and kill us venison ?and yet it irks me,the poor dappled fools,being native burghers of this desert city,should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gor\\'d.indeed,my lord,the melancholy jaques grieves at that;and,in that kind,swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish\\'d you.to-day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood;to the which place a poor sequester\\'d stag,that from the hunters\\' aim had ta\\'en a hurt,did come to languish;and,indeed,my lord,the wretched animal heav\\'d forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting,and the big round tears cours\\'d one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase;and thus the hairy fool,much marked of the melancholy jaques,stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,augmenting it with tears.but what said jaques ?did he not moralize this spectacle ?o,yes,into a thousand similes.first,for his weeping into the needless stream;\\'poor deer,\\' quoth he,\\'thou mak\\'st a testament as worldlings do,giving thy sum of more to that which had too much :\\' then,being there alone,left and abandon\\'d of his velvet friends;\\'\\'tis right,\\' quoth he;\\'thus misery doth part the flux of company :\\' anon,a careless herd,full of the pasture,jumps along by him and never stays to greet him;\\'ay,\\' quoth jaques,\\'sweep on,you fat and greasy citizens;\\'tis just the fashion;wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there ?\\' thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country,city,court,yea,and of this our life;swearing that we are mere usurpers,tyrants,and what\\'s worse,to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign\\'d and native dwelling-place.and did you leave him in this contemplation ?we did,my lord,weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer.show me the place.i love to cope him in these sullen fits,for then he\\'s full of matter.i\\'ll bring you to him straight.can it be possible that no man saw them ?it cannot be : some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this.i cannot hear of any that did see her.the ladies,her attendants of her chamber,saw her a-bed;and,in the morning early they found the bed untreasur\\'d of their mistress.my lord,the roynish clown,at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh,is also missing.hisperia,the princess\\' gentlewoman,confesses that she secretly o\\'erheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles;and she believes,wherever they are gone,that youth is surely in their company.send to his brother;fetch that gallant hither;if he be absent,bring his brother to me;i\\'ll make him find him.do this suddenly,and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways.who\\'s there ?what ! my young master ? o my gentle master !o my sweet master ! o you memory of old sir rowland ! why,what make you here ?why are you virtuous ? why do people love you ?and wherefore are you gentle,strong,and valiant ?why would you be so fond to overcome the bony priser of the humorous duke ?your praise is come too swiftly home before you.know you not,master,to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?no more do yours : your virtues,gentle master,are sanctified and holy traitors to you.o,what a world is this,when what is comely envenoms him that bears it !why,what\\'s the matter ?o unhappy youth !come not within these doors;within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives.your brother,no,no brother;yet the son,yet not the son,i will not call him son of him i was about to call his father,hath heard your praises,and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie,and you within it : if he fail of that,he will have other means to cut you off.i overheard him and his practices.this is no place;this house is but a butchery :abhor it,fear it,do not enter it.why,whither,adam,wouldst thou have me go ?no matter whither,so you come not here.what ! wouldst thou have me go and beg my food ?or with a base and boisterous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road ?this i must do,or know not what to do :yet this i will not do,do how i can;i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother.but do not so.i have five hundred crowns,the thrifty hire i sav\\'d under your father,which i did store to be my foster-nurse when service should in my old limbs lie lame,and unregarded age in corners thrown.take that;and he that doth the ravens feed,yea,providently caters for the sparrow,be comfort to my age ! here is the gold;all this i give you.let me be your servant :though i look old,yet i am strong and lusty;for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility;therefore my age is as a lusty winter,frosty,but kindly.let me go with you;i\\'ll do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities.o good old man ! how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world,when service sweat for duty,not for meed !thou art not for the fashion of these times,where none will sweat but for promotion,and having that,do choke their service up even with the having : it is not so with thee.but,poor old man,thou prun\\'st a rotten tree,that cannot so much as a blossom yield,in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.but come thy ways,we\\'ll go along together,and ere we have thy youthful wages spent,we\\'ll light upon some settled low content.master,go on,and i will follow thee to the last gasp with truth and loyalty.from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here lived i,but now live here no more.at seventeen years many their fortunes seek;but at fourscore it is too late a week :yet fortune cannot recompense me better than to die well and not my master\\'s debtor.o jupiter ! how weary are my spirits.i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary.i could find it in my heart to disgrace my man\\'s apparel and to cry like a woman;but i must comfort the weaker vessel,as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat : therefore,courage,good aliena.i pray you,bear with me : i cannot go no further.for my part,i had rather bear with you than bear you;yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you,for i think you have no money in your purse.well,this is the forest of arden.ay,now am i in arden;the more fool i : when i was at home,i was in a better place : but travellers must be content.ay,be so,good touchstone.look you,who comes here;a young man and an old in solemn talk.that is the way to make her scorn you still.o corin,that thou knew\\'st how i do love her !i partly guess,for i have lov\\'d ere now.no,corin;being old,thou canst not guess,though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sigh\\'d upon a midnight pillow :but if thy love were ever like to mine,as sure i think did never man love so,how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?into a thousand that i have forgotten.o ! thou didst then ne\\'er love so heartily.if thou remember\\'st not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into,thou hast not lov\\'d :or if thou hast not sat as i do now,wearing thy hearer with thy mistress\\' praise,thou hast not lov\\'d :or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly,as my passion now makes me,thou hast not lov\\'d.o phebe,phebe,phebe !alas,poor shepherd ! searching of thy wound,i have by hard adventure found mine own.and i mine.i remember,when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone,and bid him take that for coming a-night to jane smile;and i remember the kissing of her batler,and the cow\\'s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked;and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her,from whom i took two cods,and giving her them again,said with weeping tears,\\'wear these for my sake.\\' we that are true lovers run into strange capers;but as all is mortal in nature,so is all nature in love mortal in folly.thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.nay,i shall ne\\'er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it.jove,jove ! this shepherd\\'s passion is much upon my fashion.and mine;but it grows something stale with me.i pray you,one of you question yond man,if he for gold will give us any food :i faint almost to death.holla,you clown !peace,fool : he\\'s not thy kinsman.who calls ?your betters,sir.else are they very wretched.peace,i say.good even to you,friend.and to you,gentle sir,and to you all.i prithee,shepherd,if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment,bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.here\\'s a young maid with travel much oppress\\'d,and faints for succour.fair sir,i pity her,and wish,for her sake more than for mine own,my fortunes were more able to relieve her;but i am shepherd to another man,and do not shear the fleeces that i graze :my master is of churlish disposition and little recks to find the way to heaven by doing deeds of hospitality.besides,his cote,his flocks,and bounds of feed are now on sale;and at our sheepcote now,by reason of his absence,there is nothing that you will feed on;but what is,come see,and in my voice most welcome shall you be.what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?that young swain that you saw here but erewhile,that little cares for buying anything.i pray thee,if it stand with honesty,buy thou the cottage,pasture,and the flock,and thou shalt have to pay for it of us.and we will mend thy wages.i like this place,and willingly could waste my time in it.assuredly the thing is to be sold :go with me : if you like upon report the soil,the profit,and this kind of life,i will your very faithful feeder be,and buy it with your gold right suddenly.under the greenwood tree who loves to lie with me,and turn his merry note unto the sweet bird\\'s throat,come hither,come hither,come hither :here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather.more,more,i prithee,more.it will make you melancholy,monsieur jaques.i thank it.more ! i prithee,more.i can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.more ! i prithee,more.my voice is ragged;i know i cannot please you.i do not desire you to please me;i do desire you to sing.come,more;another stanzo : call you them stanzos ?what you will,monsieur jaques.nay,i care not for their names;they owe me nothing.will you sing ?more at your request than to please myself.well then,if ever i thank any man,i\\'ll thank you : but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two dog-apes,and when a man thanks me heartily,methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks.come,sing;and you that will not,hold your tongues.well,i\\'ll end the song.sirs,cover the while;the duke will drink under this tree.he hath been all this day to look you.and i have been all this day to avoid him.he is too disputable for my company : i think of as many matters as he,but i give heaven thanks,and make no boast of them.come,warble;come.who doth ambition shun,and loves to live i\\' the sun,secking the food he eats,and pleas\\'d with what he gets.come hither,come hither,come hither :here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather.i\\'ll give you a verse to this note,that i made yesterday in despite of my invention.and i\\'ll sing it.thus it goes :if it do come to pass that any man turn ass,leaving his wealth and ease,a stubborn will to please,ducdame,ducdame,ducdame :here shall he see gross fools as he,an if he will come to me.what\\'s that \\'ducdame ?\\' \\'tis a greek invocation to call fools into a circle.i\\'ll go sleep if i can;if i cannot,i\\'ll rail against all the first-born of egypt.and i\\'ll go seek the duke : his banquet is prepared.dear master,i can go no further : o ! i die for food.here lie i down,and measure out my grave.farewell,kind master.why,how now,adam ! no greater heart in thee ? live a little;comfort a little;cheer thyself a little.if this uncouth forest yield anything savage,i will either be food for it,or bring it for food to thee.thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.for my sake be comfortable,hold death awhile at the arm\\'s end,i will here be with thee presently,and if i bring thee not something to eat,i will give thee leave to die;but if thou diest before i come,thou art a mocker of my labour.well said ! thou lookest cheerly,and i\\'ll be with thee quickly.yet thou liest in the bleak air : come i will bear thee to some shelter,and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner,if there live anything in this desert.cheerly,good adam.i think he be transform\\'d into a beast,for i can nowhere find him like a man.my lord,he is but even now gone hence :here was he merry,hearing of a song.if he,compact of jars,grow musical,we shall have shortly discord in the spheres.go,seek him : tell him i would speak with him.he saves my labour by his own approach.why,how now,monsieur ! what a life is this,that your poor friends must woo your company ?what,you look merrily !a fool,a fool ! i met a fool i\\' the forest,a motley fool;a miserable world !as i do live by food,i met a fool;who laid him down and bask\\'d him in the sun,and rail\\'d on lady fortune in good terms,in good set terms,and yet a motley fool.\\'good morrow,fool,\\' quoth i.\\'no,sir,\\' quoth he,\\'call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.\\' and then he drew a dial from his poke,and,looking on it with lack-lustre eye,says very wisely,\\'it is ten o\\'clock;thus may we see,\\' quoth he,\\'how the world wags :\\'tis but an hour ago since it was nine,and after one hour more \\'twill be eleven;and so,from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,and then from hour to hour we rot and rot,and thereby hangs a tale.\\' when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time,my lungs began to crow like chanticleer,that fools should be so deep-contemplative,and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial.o noble fool !a worthy fool ! motley\\'s the only wear.what fool is this ?o worthy fool ! one that hath been a courtier,and says,if ladies be but young and fair,they have the gift to know it;and in his brain,which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage,he hath strange places cramm\\'d with observation,the which he vents in mangled forms.o that i were a fool !i am ambitious for a motley coat.thou shalt have one.it is my only suit;provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise.i must have liberty withal,as large a charter as the wind,to blow on whom i please;for so fools have :and they that are most galled with my folly,they most must laugh.and why,sir,must they so ?the \\'why\\' is plain as way to parish church :he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly,although he smart,not to seem senseless of the bob;if not,the wise man\\'s folly is anatomiz\\'d even by the squandering glances of the fool.invest me in my motley;give me leave to speak my mind,and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th\\' infected world,if they will patiently receive my medicine.fie on thee ! i can tell what thou wouldst do.what,for a counter,would i do,but good ?most mischievous foul sin,in chiding sin :for thou thyself hast been a libertine,as sensual as the brutish sting itself;and all the embossed sores and headed evils,that thou with licence of free foot hast caught,wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.why,who cries out on pride,that can therein tax any private party ?doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,till that the weary very means do ebb ?what woman in the city do i name,when that i say the city-woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders ?who can come in and say that i mean her,when such a one as she such is her neighbour ?or what is he of basest function,that says his bravery is not on my cost,thinking that i mean him,but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech ?there then;how then ? what then ? let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong\\'d him : if it do him right,then he hath wrong\\'d himself;if he be free,why then,my taxing like a wild goose flies,unclaim\\'d of any man.but who comes here ?forbear,and eat no more.why,i have eat none yet.nor shalt not,till necessity be serv\\'d.of what kind should this cock come of ?art thou thus bolden\\'d,man,by thy distress,or else a rude despiser of good manners,that in civility thou seem\\'st so empty ?you touch\\'d my vein at first : the thorny point of bare distress hath ta\\'en from me the show of smooth civility;yet i am inland bred and know some nurture.but forbear,i say :he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered.an you will not be answered with reason,i must die.what would you have ? your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness.i almost die for food;and let me have it.sit down and feed,and welcome to our table.speak you so gently ? pardon me,i pray you :i thought that all things had been savage here,and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment.but whate\\'er you are that in this desert inaccessible,under the shade of melancholy boughs,lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;if ever you have look\\'d on better days,if ever been where bells have knoll\\'d to church,if ever sat at any good man\\'s feast,if ever from your eyelids wip\\'d a tear,and know what \\'tis to pity,and be pitied,let gentleness my strong enforcement be :in the which hope i blush,and hide my sword.true is it that we have seen better days,and have with holy bell been knoll\\'d to church,and sat at good men\\'s feasts,and wip\\'d our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engender\\'d;and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minister\\'d.then but forbear your food a little while,whiles,like a doe,i go to find my fawn and give it food.there is an old poor man,who after me hath many a weary step limp\\'d in pure love : till he be first suffic\\'d,oppress\\'d with two weak evils,age and hunger,i will not touch a bit.go find him out,and we will nothing waste till you return.i thank ye;and be bless\\'d for your good comfort !thou seest we are not all alone unhappy :this wide and universal theatre presents more woful pageants than the scene wherein we play in.all the world\\'s a stage,and all the men and women merely players :they have their exits and their entrances;and one man in his time plays many parts,his acts being seven ages.at first the infant,mewling and puking in the nurse\\'s arms.and then the whining school-boy,with his satchel,and shining morning face,creeping like snail unwillingly to school.and then the lover,sighing like furnace,with a woful ballad made to his mistress\\' eyebrow.then a soldier,full of strange oaths,and bearded like the pard,jealous in honour,sudden and quick in quarrel,seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon\\'s mouth.and then the justice,in fair round belly with good capon lin\\'d,with eyes severe,and beard of formal cut,full of wise saws and modern instances;and so he plays his part.the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper\\'d pantaloon,with spectacles on nose and pouch on side,his youthful hose well sav\\'d,a world too wide for his shrunk shank;and his big manly voice,turning again toward childish treble,pipes and whistles in his sound.last scene of all,that ends this strange eventful history,is second childishness and mere oblivion,sans teeth,sans eyes,sans taste,sans everything.welcome.set down your venerable burden,and let him feed.i thank you most for him.so had you need :i scarce can speak to thank you for myself.welcome;fall to : i will not trouble you as yet,to question you about your fortunes.give us some music;and,good cousin,sing.blow,blow,thou winter wind,thou art not so unkind as man\\'s ingratitude;thy tooth is not so keen,because thou art not seen,although thy breath be rude.heigh-ho ! sing,heigh-ho ! unto the green holly :most friendship is feigning,most loving mere folly.then heigh-ho ! the holly !this life is most jolly.freeze,freeze,thou bitter sky,that dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot :though thou the waters warp,thy sting is not so sharp as friend remember\\'d not.heigh-ho ! sing,heigh-ho ! unto the green holly :most friendship is feigning,most loving mere folly.then heigh-ho ! the holly !this life is most jolly.if that you were the good sir rowland\\'s son,as you have whisper\\'d faithfully you were,and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limn\\'d and living in your face,be truly welcome hither : i am the duke that lov\\'d your father : the residue of your fortune,go to my cave and tell me.good old man,thou art right welcome as thy master is.support him by the arm.give me your hand,and let me all your fortunes understand.not seen him since ! sir,sir,that cannot be :but were i not the better part made mercy,i should not seek an absent argument of my revenge,thou present.but look to it :find out thy brother,wheresoe\\'er he is;seek him with candle;bring him,dead or living,within this twelvemonth,or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory.thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine worth seizure,do we seize into our hands,till thou canst quit thee by thy brother\\'s mouth of what we think against thee.o that your highness knew my heart in this !i never lov\\'d my brother in my life.more villain thou.well,push him out of doors;and let my officers of such a nature make an extent upon his house and lands.do this expediently and turn him going.hang there,my verse,in witness of my love :and thou,thrice-crowned queen of night,survey with thy chaste eye,from thy pale sphere above,thy huntress\\' name,that my full life doth sway.o rosalind ! these trees shall be my books,and in their barks my thoughts i\\'ll character,that every eye,which in this forest looks,shall see thy virtue witness\\'d everywhere.run,run,orlando : carve on every tree the fair,the chaste,and unexpressive she.and how like you this shepherd\\'s life,master touchstone ?truly,shepherd,in respect of itself,it is a good life;but in respect that it is a shepherd\\'s life,it is naught.in respect that it is solitary,i like it very well;but in respect that it is private,it is a very vile life.now,in respect it is in the fields,it pleaseth me well;but in respect it is not in the court,it is tedious.as it is a spare life,look you,it fits my humour well;but as there is no more plenty in it,it goes much against my stomach.hast any philosophy in thee,shepherd ?no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is;and that he that wants money,means,and content,is without three good friends;that the property of rain is to wet,and fire to burn;that good pasture makes fat sheep,and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun;that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,or comes of a very dull kindred.such a one is a natural philosopher.wast ever in court,shepherd ?no,truly.then thou art damned.nay,i hope.truly,thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg,all on one side.for not being at court ? your reason.why,if thou never wast at court,thou never sawest good manners;if thou never sawest good manners,then thy manners must be wicked;and wickedness is sin,and sin is damnation.thou art in a parlous state,shepherd.not a whit,touchstone : those that are good manners at the court,are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court.you told me you salute not at the court,but you kiss your hands;that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.instance,briefly;come,instance.why,we are still handling our ewes,and their fells,you know,are greasy.why,do not your courtier\\'s hands sweat ? and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ? shallow,shallow.a better instance,i say;come.besides,our hands are hard.your lips will feel them the sooner : shallow again.a more sounder instance;come.and they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep;and would you have us kiss tar ? the courtier\\'s hands are perfumed with civet.most shallow man ! thou worms-meat,in respect of a good piece of flesh,indeed ! learn of the wise,and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar,the very uncleanly flux of a cat.mend the instance,shepherd.you have too courtly a wit for me : i\\'ll rest.wilt thou rest damned ? god help thee,shallow man ! god make incision in thee ! thou art raw.sir,i am a true labourer : i earn that i eat,get that i wear,owe no man hate,envy no man\\'s happiness,glad of other men\\'s good,content with my harm;and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.that is another simple sin in you,to bring the ewes and the rams together,and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle;to be bawd to a bell-wether,and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated,old,cuckoldy ram,out of all reasonable match.if thou be\\'st not damned for this,the devil himself will have no shepherds : i cannot see else how thou shouldst \\'scape.here comes young master ganymede,my new mistress\\'s brother.from the east to western ind,no jewel is like rosalind her worth,being mounted on the wind,through all the world bears rosalind.all the pictures fairest lin\\'d are but black to rosalind.let no face be kept in mind,but the fair of rosalind.i\\'ll rime you so,eight years together,dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted : it is the right butter-women\\'s rank to market.out,fool !for a taste :if a hart do lack a hind,let him seek out rosalind.if the cat will after kind,so be sure will rosalind.winter-garments must be lin\\'d,so must slender rosalind.they that reap must sheaf and bind,then to cart with rosalind.sweetest nut hath sourest rind,such a nut is rosalind.he that sweetest rose will find must find love\\'s prick and rosalind.this is the very false gallop of verses : why do you infect yourself with them ?peace ! you dull fool : i found them on a tree.truly,the tree yields bad fruit.i\\'ll graff it with you,and then i shall graff it with a medlar : then it will be the earliest fruit i\\' the country;for you\\'ll be rotten ere you be half ripe,and that\\'s the right virtue of the medlar.you have said;but whether wisely or no,let the forest judge.peace !here comes my sister,reading : stand aside.why should this a desert be ?for it is unpeopled ? no;tongues i\\'ll hang on every tree,that shall civil sayings show.some,how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage,that the stretching of a span buckles in his sum of age;some,of violated vows \\'twixt the souls of friend and friend :but upon the fairest boughs,or at every sentence\\' end,will i rosalinda write;teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show.therefore heaven nature charg\\'d that one body should be fill\\'d with all graces wide enlarg\\'d :nature presently distill\\'d helen\\'s cheek,but not her heart,cleopatra\\'s majesty,atalanta\\'s better part,sad lucretia\\'s modesty.thus rosalind of many parts by heavenly synod was devis\\'d of many faces,eyes,and hearts,to have the touches dearest priz\\'d.heaven would that she these gifts should have,and i to live and die her slave.o most gentle pulpiter ! what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal,and never cried,\\'have patience,good people !\\' how now ! back,friends ! shepherd,go off a little : go with him,sirrah.come,shepherd,let us make an honourable retreat;though not with bag and baggage,yet with scrip and scrippage.didst thou hear these verses ?o,yes,i heard them all,and more too;for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.that\\'s no matter : the feet might bear the verses.ay,but the feet were lame,and could not bear themselves without the verse,and therefore stood lamely in the verse.but didst thou hear without wondering,how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came;for look here what i found on a palm-tree : i was never so be-rimed since pythagoras\\' time,that i was an irish rat,which i can hardly remember.trow you who hath done this ?is it a man ?and a chain,that you once wore,about his neck.change you colour ?i prithee,who ?o lord,lord ! it is a hard matter for friends to meet;but mountains may be removed with earthquakes,and so encounter.nay,but who is it ?is it possible ?nay,i prithee now,with most petitionary vehemence,tell me who it is.o wonderful,wonderful,and most wonderful wonderful ! and yet again wonderful ! and after that,out of all whooping !good my complexion ! dost thou think,though i am caparison\\'d like a man,i have a doublet and hose in my disposition ? one inch of delay more is a south-sea of discovery;i prithee,tell me who is it quickly,and speak apace.i would thou couldst stammer,that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth,as wine comes out of a narrow-mouth\\'d bottle;either too much at once,or none at all.i prithee,take the cork out of thy mouth,that i may drink thy tidings.so you may put a man in your belly.is he of god\\'s making ? what manner of man ? is his head worth a hat,or his chin worth a beard ?nay,he hath but a little beard.why,god will send more,if the man will be thankful.let me stay the growth of his beard,if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.it is young orlando,that tripped up the wrestler\\'s heels and your heart both,in an instant.nay,but the devil take mocking : speak,sad brow and true maid.i\\' faith,coz,\\'tis he.orlando ?orlando.alas the day ! what shall i do with my doublet and hose ? what did he when thou sawest him ? what said he ? how looked he ? wherein went he ? what makes he here ? did he ask for me ? where remains he ? how parted he with thee,and when shalt thou see him again ? answer me in one word.you must borrow me gargantua\\'s mouth first : \\'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age\\'s size.to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man\\'s apparel ? looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover;but take a taste of my finding him,and relish it with good observance.i found him under a tree,like a dropped acorn.it may well be called jove\\'s tree,when it drops forth such fruit.give me audience,good madam.proceed.there lay he,stretch\\'d along like a wounded knight.though it be pity to see such a sight,it well becomes the ground.cry \\'holla !\\' to thy tongue,i prithee;it curvets unseasonably.he was furnish\\'d like a hunter.o,ominous ! he comes to kill my heart.i would sing my song without a burthen : thou bringest me out of tune.do you not know i am a woman ? when i think,i must speak.sweet,say on.you bring me out.soft ! comes he not here ?\\'tis he : slink by,and note him.i thank you for your company;but,good faith,i had as lief have been myself alone.and so had i;but yet,for fashion\\' sake,i thank you too for your society.god be wi\\' you : let\\'s meet as little as we can.i do desire we may be better strangers.i pray you,mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barks.i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.rosalind is your love\\'s name ?yes,just.i do not like her name.there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.what stature is she of ?just as high as my heart.you are full of pretty answers.have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths\\' wives,and conn\\'d them out of rings ?not so;but i answer you right painted cloth,from whence you have studied your questions.you have a nimble wit : i think \\'twas made of atalanta\\'s heels.will you sit down with me ? and we two will rail against our mistress the world,and all our misery.i will chide no breather in the world but myself,against whom i know most faults.the worst fault you have is to be in love.\\'tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue.i am weary of you.by my troth,i was seeking for a fool when i found you.he is drowned in the brook : look but in,and you shall see him.there i shall see mine own figure.which i take to be either a fool or a cipher.i\\'ll tarry no longer with you.farewell,good signior love.i am glad of your departure.adieu,good monsieur melancholy.i will speak to him like a saucy lackey,and under that habit play the knave with him.do you hear,forester ?very well : what would you ?i pray you,what is\\'t o\\'clock ?you should ask me,what time o\\' day;there\\'s no clock in the forest.then there is no true lover in the forest;else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.and why not the swift foot of time ? had not that been as proper ?by no means,sir.time travels in divers paces with divers persons.i\\'ll tell you who time ambles withal,who time trots withal,who time gallops withal,and who he stands still withal.i prithee,who doth he trot withal ?marry,he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized;if the interim be but a se\\'nnight,time\\'s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.who ambles time withal ?with a priest that lacks latin,and a rich man that hath not the gout;for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain;the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning,the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury.these time ambles withal.who doth he gallop withal ?with a thief to the gallows;for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there.who stays it still withal ?with lawyers in the vacation;for they sleep between term and term,and then they perceive not how time moves.where dwell you,pretty youth ?with this shepherdess,my sister;here in the skirts of the forest,like fringe upon a petticoat.are you native of this place ?as the cony,that you see dwell where she is kindled.your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.i have been told so of many : but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak,who was in his youth an inland man;one that knew courtship too well,for there he fell in love.i have heard him read many lectures against it;and i thank god,i am not a woman,to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?there were none principal;they were all like one another as half-pence are;every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.i prithee,recount some of them.no,i will not cast away my physic,but on those that are sick.there is a man haunts the forest,that abuses our young plants with carving \\'rosalind\\' on their barks;hangs odes upon hawthorns,and elegies on brambles;all,forsooth,deifying the name of rosalind : if i could meet that fancy-monger,i would give him some good counsel,for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.i am he that is so love-shaked.i pray you,tell me your remedy.there is none of my uncle\\'s marks upon you : he taught me how to know a man in love;in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner.what were his marks ?a lean cheek,which you have not;a blue eye and sunken,which you have not;an unquestionable spirit,which you have not;a beard neglected,which you have not : but i pardon you for that,for,simply,your having in beard is a younger brother\\'s revenue.then,your hose should be ungartered,your bonnet unbanded,your sleeve unbuttoned,your shoe untied,and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.but you are no such man : you are rather point-device in your accoutrements;as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.fair youth,i would i could make thee believe i love.me believe it ! you may as soon make her that you love believe it;which,i warrant,she is apter to do than to confess she does;that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences.but,in good sooth,are you he that hangs the verses on the trees,wherein rosalind is so admired ?i swear to thee,youth,by the white hand of rosalind,i am that he,that unfortunate he.but are you so much in love as your rimes speak ?neither rime nor reason can express how much.love is merely a madness,and,i tell you,deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do;and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is,that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too.yet i profess curing it by counsel.did you ever cure any so ?yes,one;and in this manner.he was to imagine me his love,his mistress;and i set him every day to woo me : at which time would i,being but a moonish youth,grieve,be effeminate,changeable,longing and liking;proud,fantastical,apish,shallow,inconstant,full of tears,full of smiles,for every passion something,and for no passion truly anything,as boys and women are,for the most part,cattle of this colour;would now like him,now loathe him;then entertain him,then forswear him;now weep for him,then spit at him;that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness,which was,to forswear the full stream of the world,and to live in a nook merely monastic.and thus i cured him;and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep\\'s heart,that there shall not be one spot of love in\\'t.i would not be cured,youth.i would cure you,if you would but call me rosalind,and come every day to my cote and woo me.now,by the faith of my love,i will : tell me where it is.go with me to it and i\\'ll show it you;and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live.will you go ?with all my heart,good youth.nay,you must call me rosalind.come,sister,will you go ?come apace,good audrey : i will fetch up your goats,audrey.and how,audrey ? am i the man yet ? doth my simple feature content you ?your features ! lord warrant us ! what features ?i am here with thee and thy goats,as the most capricious poet,honest ovid,was among the goths.o knowledge ill-inhabited,worse than jove in a thatch\\'d house !when a man\\'s verses cannot be understood,nor a man\\'s good wit seconded with the forward child understanding,it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.truly,i would the gods had made thee poetical.i do not know what \\'poetical\\' is.is it honest in deed and word ? is it a true thing ?no,truly,for the truest poetry is the most feigning;and lovers are given to poetry,and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?i do,truly;for thou swearest to me thou art honest : now,if thou wert a poet,i might have some hope thou didst feign.would you not have me honest ?no,truly,unless thou wert hard-favour\\'d;for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.a material fool.well,i am not fair,and therefore i pray the gods make me honest.truly,and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.i am not a slut,though i thank the gods i am foul.well,praised be the gods for thy foulness ! sluttishness may come hereafter.but be it as it may be,i will marry thee;and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext,the vicar of the next village,who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest,and to couple us.i would fain see this meeting.well,the gods give us joy !amen.a man may,if he were of a fearful heart,stagger in this attempt;for here we have no temple but the wood,no assembly but horn-beasts.but what though ? courage ! as horns are odious,they are necessary.it is said,\\'many a man knows no end of his goods :\\' right;many a man has good horns,and knows no end of them.well,that is the dowry of his wife;\\'tis none of his own getting.horns ? even so.poor men alone ? no,no;the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal.is the single man therefore blessed ? no : as a walled town is more worthier than a village,so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor;and by how much defence is better than no skill,by so much is a horn more precious than to want.here comes sir oliver.sir oliver martext,you are well met : will you dispatch us here under this tree,or shall we go with you to your chapel ?is there none here to give the woman ?i will not take her on gift of any man.truly,she must be given,or the marriage is not lawful.proceed,proceed : i\\'ll give her.good even,good master what-ye-call\\'t.how do you,sir ? you are very well met : god \\'ild you for your last company : i am very glad to see you : even a toy in hand here,sir : nay,pray be covered.will you be married,motley ?as the ox hath his bow,sir,the horse his curb,and the falcon her bells,so man hath his desires;and as pigeons bill,so wedlock would be nibbling.and will you,being a man of your breeding,be married under a bush,like a beggar ? get you to church,and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is : this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot;then one of you will prove a shrunk panel,and like green timber,warp,warp.i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another : for he is not like to marry me well,and not being well married,it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.go thou with me,and let me counsel thee.come,sweet audrey :we must be married,or we must live in bawdry.farewell,good master oliver : not o sweet oliver !o brave oliver !leave me not behind thee :but,wind away,begone,i say,i will not to wedding with thee.\\'tis no matter : ne\\'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.never talk to me : i will weep.do,i prithee;but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.but have i not cause to weep ?as good cause as one would desire;therefore weep.his very hair is of the dissembling colour.something browner than judas\\'s;marry,his kisses are judas\\'s own children.i\\' faith,his hair is of a good colour.an excellent colour : your chesnut was ever the only colour.and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana : a nun of winter\\'s sisterhood kisses not more religiously;the very ice of chastity is in them.but why did he swear he would come this morning,and comes not ?nay,certainly,there is no truth in him.do you think so ?yes : i think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer;but for his verity in love,i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.not true in love ?yes,when he is in;but i think he is not in.you have heard him swear downright he was.\\'was\\' is not \\'is :\\' besides,the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster;they are both the confirmers of false reckonings.he attends here in the forest on the duke your father.i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him.he asked me of what parentage i was;i told him,of as good as he;so he laughed,and let me go.but what talk we of fathers,when there is such a man as orlando ?o,that\\'s a brave man ! he writes brave verses,speaks brave words,swears brave oaths,and breaks them bravely,quite traverse,athwart the heart of his lover;as a puisny tilter,that spurs his horse but on one side,breaks his staff like a noble goose.but all\\'s brave that youth mounts and folly guides.who comes here ?mistress and master,you have oft inquir\\'d after the shepherd that complain\\'d of love,who you saw sitting by me on the turf,praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress.well,and what of him ?if you will see a pageant truly play\\'d,between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,go hence a little,and i shall conduct you,if you will mark it.o ! come,let us remove :the sight of lovers feedeth those in love.bring us to this sight,and you shall say i\\'ll prove a busy actor in their play.sweet phebe,do not scorn me;do not,phebe :say that you love me not,but say not so in bitterness.the common executioner,whose heart the accustom\\'d sight of death makes hard,falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon : will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops ?i would not be thy executioner :i fly thee,for i would not injure thee.thou tell\\'st me there is murder in mine eye :\\'tis pretty,sure,and very probable,that eyes,that are the frail\\'st and softest things,who shut their coward gates on atomies,should be call\\'d tyrants,butchers,murderers !now i do frown on thee with all my heart;and,if mine eyes can wound,now let them kill thee;now counterfeit to swound;why now fall down;or,if thou canst not,o ! for shame,for shame,lie not,to say mine eyes are murderers.now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee;scratch thee but with a pin,and there remains some scar of it;lean but upon a rush,the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps;but now mine eyes,which i have darted at thee,hurt thee not,nor,i am sure,there is no force in eyes that can do hurt.o dear phebe,if ever,as that ever may be near,you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,then shall you know the wounds invisible that love\\'s keen arrows make.but,till that time come not thou near me;and,when that time comes,afflict me with thy mocks,pity me not;as,till that time i shall not pity thee.and why,i pray you ? who might be your mother,that you insult,exult,and all at once,over the wretched ? what though you have no beauty,as by my faith,i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed,must you be therefore proud and pitiless ?why,what means this ? why do you look on me ?i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature\\'s sale-work.od\\'s my little life !i think she means to tangle my eyes too.no,faith,proud mistress,hope not after it :\\'tis not your inky brows,your black silk hair,your bugle eyeballs,nor your cheek of cream,that can entame my spirits to your worship.you foolish shepherd,wherefore do you follow her,like foggy south puffing with wind and rain ?you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman : \\'tis such fools as you that make the world full of ill-favour\\'d children :\\'tis not her glass,but you,that flatters her;and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her.but,mistress,know yourself : down on your knees,and thank heaven,fasting,for a good man\\'s love :for i must tell you friendly in your ear,sell when you can;you are not for all markets.cry the man mercy;love him;take his offer :foul is most foul,being foul to be a scoffer.so take her to thee,shepherd.fare you well.sweet youth,i pray you,chide a year together :i had rather hear you chide than this man woo.he\\'s fallen in love with her foulness,and she\\'ll fall in love with my anger.if it be so,as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks,i\\'ll sauce her with bitter words.why look you so upon me ?for no ill will i bear you.i pray you,do not fall in love with me,for i am falser than vows made in wine :besides,i like you not.if you will know my house,\\'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.will you go,sister ? shepherd,ply her hard.come,sister.shepherdess,look on him better,and be not proud : though all the world could see,none could be so abus\\'d in sight as he.come,to our flock.dead shepherd,now i find thy saw of might :\\'who ever lov\\'d that lov\\'d not at first sight ?\\' sweet phebe,ha ! what sayst thou,silvius ?sweet phebe,pity me.why,i am sorry for thee,gentle silvius.wherever sorrow is,relief would be :if you do sorrow at my grief in love,by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermin\\'d.thou hast my love : is not that neighbourly ?i would have you.why,that were covetousness.silvius,the time was that i hated thee;and yet it is not that i bear thee love :but since that thou canst talk of love so well,thy company,which erst was irksome to me,i will endure,and i\\'ll employ thee too;but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ\\'d.so holy and so perfect is my love,and i in such a poverty of grace,that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps : loose now and then a scatter\\'d smile,and that i\\'ll live upon.know\\'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?not very well,but i have met him oft;and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of.think not i love him,though i ask for him.\\'tis but a peevish boy;yet he talks well;but what care i for words ? yet words do well,when he that speaks them pleases those that hear.it is a pretty youth : not very pretty :but,sure,he\\'s proud;and yet his pride becomes him :he\\'ll make a proper man : the best thing in him is his complexion;and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up.he is not very tall;yet for his years he\\'s tall :his leg is but so so;and yet \\'tis well :there was a pretty redness in his lip,a little riper and more lusty red than that mix\\'d in his cheek;\\'twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.there be some women,silvius,had they mark\\'d him in parcels as i did,would have gone near to fall in love with him;but,for my part,i love him not nor hate him not;and yet have more cause to hate him than to love him :for what had he to do to chide at me ?he said mine eyes were black and my hair black;and,now i am remember\\'d,scorn\\'d at me.i marvel why i answer\\'d not again :but that\\'s all one;omittance is no quittance.i\\'ll write to him a very taunting letter,and thou shalt bear it : wilt thou,silvius ?phebe,with all my heart.i\\'ll write it straight;the matter\\'s in my head and in my heart :i will be bitter with him and passing short.go with me,silvius.i prithee,pretty youth,let me be better acquainted with thee.they say you are a melancholy fellow.i am so;i do love it better than laughing.those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows,and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.why,\\'tis good to be sad and say nothing.why,then,\\'tis good to be a post.i have neither the scholar\\'s melancholy,which is emulation;nor the musician\\'s,which is fantastical;nor the courtier\\'s,which is proud;nor the soldier\\'s,which is ambitious;nor the lawyer\\'s,which is politic;nor the lady\\'s,which is nice;nor the lover\\'s,which is all these : but it is a melancholy of mine own,compounded of many simples,extracted from many objects,and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels,which,by often rumination,wraps me in a most humorous sadness.a traveller ! by my faith,you have great reason to be sad.i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men\\'s;then,to have seen much and to have nothing,is to have rich eyes and poor hands.yes,i have gained my experience.and your experience makes you sad : i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad : and to travel for it too !good day,and happiness,dear rosalind !nay then,god be wi\\' you,an you talk in blank verse.farewell,monsieur traveller : look you lisp,and wear strange suits,disable all the benefits of your own country,be out of love with your nativity,and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are;or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola.why,how now,orlando ! where have you been all this while ? you a lover ! an you serve me such another trick,never come in my sight more.my fair rosalind,i come within an hour of my promise.break an hour\\'s promise in love ! he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts,and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love,it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o\\' the shoulder,but i\\'ll warrant him heart-whole.pardon me,dear rosalind.nay,an you be so tardy,come no more in my sight : i had as lief be wooed of a snail.of a snail !ay,of a snail;for though he comes slowly,he carries his house on his head;a better jointure,i think,than you make a woman : besides,he brings his destiny with him.what\\'s that ?why,horns;that such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for : but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.virtue is no horn-maker;and my rosalind is virtuous.and i am your rosalind ?it pleases him to call you so;but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you.come,woo me,woo me;for now i am in a holiday humour,and like enough to consent.what would you say to me now,an i were your very very rosalind ?i would kiss before i spoke.nay,you were better speak first,and when you were gravelled for lack of matter,you might take occasion to kiss.very good orators,when they are out,they will spit;and for lovers lacking,god warn us !matter,the cleanliest shift is to kiss.how if the kiss be denied ?then she puts you to entreaty,and there begins new matter.who could be out,being before his beloved mistress ?marry,that should you,if i were your mistress;or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit.what,of my suit ?not out of your apparel,and yet out of your suit.am not i your rosalind ?i take some joy to say you are,because i would be talking of her.well,in her person i say i will not have you.then in mine own person i die.no,faith,die by attorney.the poor world is almost six thousand years old,and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person,videlicet,in a love-cause.troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club;yet he did what he could to die before,and he is one of the patterns of love.leander,he would have lived many a fair year,though hero had turned nun,if it had not been for a hot mid-summer night;for,good youth,he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont,and being taken with the cramp was drowned;and the foolish coroners of that age found it was \\'hero of sestos.\\' but these are all lies : men have died from time to time,and worms have eaten them,but not for love.i would not have my right rosalind of this mind;for,i protest,her frown might kill me.by this hand,it will not kill a fly.but come,now i will be your rosalind in a more coming-on disposition;and ask me what you will,i will grant it.then love me,rosalind.yes,faith will i,fridays and saturdays and all.and wilt thou have me ?ay,and twenty such.what sayest thou ?are you not good ?i hope so.why then,can one desire too much of a good thing ?come,sister,you shall be the priest and marry us.give me your hand,orlando.what do you say,sister ?pray thee,marry us.i cannot say the words.you must begin,\\'will you,orlando,\\' go to.will you,orlando,have to wife this rosalind ?i will.ay,but when ?why now;as fast as she can marry us.then you must say,\\'i take thee,rosalind,for wife.\\' i take thee,rosalind,for wife.i might ask you for your commission;but,i do take thee,orlando,for my husband : there\\'s a girl goes before the priest;and,certainly,a woman\\'s thought runs before her actions.so do all thoughts;they are winged.now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her ?for ever and a day.say \\'a day,\\' without the \\'ever.\\' no,no,orlando;men are april when they woo,december when they wed : maids are may when they are maids,but the sky changes when they are wives.i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock-pigeon over his hen;more clamorous than a parrot against rain;more new-fangled than an ape;more giddy in my desires than a monkey : i will weep for nothing,like diana in the fountain,and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry;i will laugh like a hyen,and that when thou art inclined to sleep.but will my rosalind do so ?by my life,she will do as i do.o ! but she is wise.or else she could not have the wit to do this : the wiser,the waywarder : make the doors upon a woman\\'s wit,and it will out at the casement;shut that,and \\'twill out at the key-hole;stop that,\\'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.a man that hath a wife with such a wit,he might say,\\'wit,whither wilt ?\\' nay,you might keep that check for it till you met your wife\\'s wit going to your neighbour\\'s bed.and what wit could wit have to excuse that ?marry,to say she came to seek you there.you shall never take her without her answer,unless you take her without her tongue.o ! that woman that cannot make her fault her husband\\'s occasion,let her never nurse her child herself,for she will breed it like a fool.for these two hours,rosalind,i will leave thee.alas ! dear love,i cannot lack thee two hours.i must attend the duke at dinner : by two o\\'clock i will be with thee again.ay,go your ways,go your ways;i knew what you would prove,my friends told me as much,and i thought no less : that flattering tongue of yours won me : \\'tis but one cast away,and so,come,death ! two o\\'clock is your hour ?ay,sweet rosalind.by my troth,and in good earnest,and so god mend me,and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour,i will think you the most pathetical break-promise,and the most hollow lover,and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind,that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful.therefore,beware my censure,and keep your promise.with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind : so,adieu.well,time is the old justice that examines all such offenders,and let time try.adieu.you have simply misused our sex in your love-prate : we must have your doublot and hose plucked over your head,and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.o coz,coz,coz,my pretty little coz,that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love ! but it cannot be sounded : my affection hath an unknown bottom,like the bay of portugal.or rather,bottomless;that as fast as you pour affection in,it runs out.no;that same wicked bastard of venus,that was begot of thought,conceived of spleen,and born of madness,that blind rascally boy that abuses every one\\'s eyes because his own are out,let him be judge how deep i am in love.i\\'ll tell thee,aliena,i cannot be out of the sight of orlando : i\\'ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.and i\\'ll sleep.which is he that killed the deer ?sir,it was i.let\\'s present him to the duke,like a roman conqueror;and it would do well to set the deer\\'s horns upon his head for a branch of victory.have you no song,forester,for this purpose ?yes,sir.sing it : \\'tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough.what shall he have that kill\\'d the deer ?his leather skin and horns to wear.then sing him home take thou no scorn to wear the horn;it was a crest ere thou wast born :thy father\\'s father wore it,and thy father bore it :the horn,the horn,the lusty horn is not a thing to laugh to scorn how say you now ? is it not past two o\\'clock ? and here much orlando !i warrant you,with pure love and a troubled brain,he hath ta\\'en his bow and arrows,and is gone forth to sleep.look,who comes here.my errand is to you,fair youth.my gentle phebe did bid me give you this :i know not the contents;but,as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it,it bears an angry tenour : pardon me;i am but as a guiltless messenger.patience herself would startle at this letter,and play the swaggerer : bear this,bear all :she says i am not fair;that i lack manners;she calls me proud,and that she could not love me were man as rare as ph nix.\\'od\\'s my will !her love is not the hare that i do hunt :why writes she so to me ? well,shepherd,well,this is a letter of your own device.no,i protest,i know not the contents :phebe did write it.come,come,you are a fool,and turn\\'d into the extremity of love.i saw her hand : she has a leathern hand,a freestone-colour\\'d hand;i verily did think that her old gloves were on,but \\'twas her hands :she has a housewife\\'s hand;but that\\'s no matter :i say she never did invent this letter;this is a man\\'s invention,and his hand.sure,it is hers.why,\\'tis a boisterous and a cruel style,a style for challengers;why,she defies me,like turk to christian : woman\\'s gentle brain could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,such ethiop words,blacker in their effect than in their countenance.will you hear the letter ?so please you,for i never heard it yet;yet heard too much of phebe\\'s cruelty.she phebes me.mark how the tyrant writes.art thou god to shepherd turn\\'d,that a maiden\\'s heart hath burn\\'d ?can a woman rail thus ?call you this railing ?why,thy godhead laid apart,warr\\'st thou with a woman\\'s heart ?did you ever hear such railing ?whiles the eye of man did woo me,that could do no vengeance to me.meaning me a beast.if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine,alack ! in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect.whiles you chid me,i did love,how then might your prayers move !he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me;and by him seal up thy mind;whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make;or else by him my love deny,and then i\\'ll study how to die.call you this chiding ?alas,poor shepherd !do you pity him ? no,he deserves no pity.wilt thou love such a woman ? what,to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee ! not to be endured ! well,go your way to her,for i see love hath made thee a tame snake,and say this to her : that if she love me,i charge her to love thee : if she will not,i will never have her,unless thou entreat for her.if you be a true lover,hence,and not a word,for here comes more company.good morrow,fair ones.pray you if you know,where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenc\\'d about with olive-trees ?west of this place,down in the neighbour bottom :the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place.but at this hour the house doth keep itself;there\\'s none within.if that an eye may profit by a tongue,then should i know you by description;such garments,and such years : \\'the boy is fair,of female favour,and bestows himself like a ripe sister : but the woman low,and browner than her brother.\\' are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for ?it is no boast,being ask\\'d,to say,we are.orlando doth commend him to you both,and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin.are you he ?i am : what must we understand by this ?some of my shame;if you will know of me what man i am,and how,and why,and where this handkercher was stain\\'d.i pray you,tell it.when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour;and,pacing through the forest,chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,lo,what befell ! he threw his eye aside,and mark what object did present itself :under an oak,whose boughs were moss\\'d with age,and high top bald with dry antiquity,a wretched ragged man,o\\'ergrown with hair,lay sleeping on his back : about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreath\\'d itself,who with her head nimble in threats approach\\'d the opening of his mouth;but suddenly,seeing orlando,it unlink\\'d itself,and with indented glides did slip away into a bush;under which bush\\'s shade a lioness,with udders all drawn dry,lay couching,head on ground,with catlike watch,when that the sleeping man should stir;for \\'tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead :this seen,orlando did approach the man,and found it was his brother,his elder brother.o ! i have heard him speak of that same brother;and he did render him the most unnatural that liv\\'d \\'mongst men.and well he might so do,for well i know he was unnatural.but,to orlando : did he leave him there,food to the suck\\'d and hungry lioness ?twice did he turn his back and purpos\\'d so;but kindness,nobler ever than revenge,and nature,stronger than his just occasion,made him give battle to the lioness,who quickly fell before him : in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awak\\'d.are you his brother ?was it you he rescu\\'d ?was\\'t you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?\\'twas i;but \\'tis not i.i do not shame to tell you what i was,since my conversion so sweetly tastes,being the thing i am.but,for the bloody napkin ?by and by.when from the first to last,betwixt us two,tears our recountments had most kindly bath\\'d,as how i came into that desert place :in brief,he led me to the gentle duke,who gave me fresh array and entertainment,committing me unto my brother\\'s love;who led me instantly unto his cave,there stripp\\'d himself;and here,upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away,which all this while had bled;and now he fainted,and cried,in fainting,upon rosalind.brief,i recover\\'d him,bound up his wound;and,after some small space,being strong at heart,he sent me hither,stranger as i am,to tell this story,that you might excuse his broken promise;and to give this napkin,dy\\'d in his blood,unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind.why,how now,ganymede ! sweet ganymede !many will swoon when they do look on blood.there is more in it.cousin ! ganymede !look,he recovers.i would i were at home.we\\'ll lead you thither.i pray you,will you take him by the arm ?be of good cheer,youth.you a man ! you lack a man\\'s heart.i do so,i confess it.ah,sirrah ! a body would think this was well counterfeited.i pray you,tell your brother how well i counterfeited.heigh-ho !this was not counterfeit : there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.counterfeit,i assure you.well then,take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.so i do;but,i\\' faith,i should have been a woman by right.come;you look paler and paler : pray you,draw homewards.good sir,go with us.that will i,for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother,rosalind.i shall devise something.but,i pray you,commend my counterfeiting to him.will you go ?we shall find a time,audrey : patience,gentle audrey.faith,the priest was good enough,for all the old gentleman\\'s saying.a most wicked sir oliver,audrey;a most vile martext.but,audrey,there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.ay,i know who \\'tis : he hath no interest in me in the world.here comes the man you mean.it is meat and drink to me to see a clown.by my troth,we that have good wits have much to answer for : we shall be flouting;we cannot hold.good even,audrey.god ye good even,william.and good even to you,sir.good even,gentle friend.cover thy head,cover thy head;nay,prithee,be covered.how old are you,friend ?five-and-twenty,sir.a ripe age.is thy name william ?william,sir.a fair name.wast born i\\' the forest here ?ay,sir,i thank god.\\'thank god;\\' a good answer.art rich ?faith,sir,so so.\\'so so,\\' is good,very good,very excellent good : and yet it is not;it is but so so.art thou wise ?ay,sir,i have a pretty wit.why,thou sayest well.i do now remember a saying,\\'the fool doth think he is wise,but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\\' the heathen philosopher,when he had a desire to eat a grape,would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open.you do love this maid ?i do,sir.give me your hand.art thou learned ?no,sir.then learn this of me : to have,is to have;for it is a figure in rhetoric,that drink,being poured out of a cup into a glass,by filling the one doth empty the other;for all your writers do consent that ipse is he : now,you are not ipse,for i am he.which he,sir ?he,sir,that must marry this woman.therefore,you clown,abandon,which is in the vulgar,leave,the society,which in the boorish is,company,of this female,which in the common is,woman;which together is,abandon the society of this female,or,clown,thou perishest;or,to thy better understanding,diest;or,to wit,i kill thee,make thee away,translate thy life into death,thy liberty into bondage.i will deal in poison with thee,or in bastinado,or in steel;i will bandy with thee in faction;i will o\\'errun thee with policy;i will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways : therefore tremble,and depart.do,good william.god rest you merry,sir.our master and mistress seek you : come,away,away !trip,audrey ! trip,audrey ! i attend,i attend.is\\'t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ? that,but seeing,you should love her ? and,loving,woo ? and,wooing,she should grant ? and will you persever to enjoy her ?neither call the giddiness of it in question,the poverty of her,the small acquaintance,my sudden wooing,nor her sudden consenting;but say with me,i love aliena;say with her,that she loves me;consent with both,that we may enjoy each other : it shall be to your good;for my father\\'s house and all the revenue that was old sir rowland\\'s will i estate upon you,and here live and die a shepherd.you have my consent.let your wedding be to-morrow : thither will i invite the duke and all\\'s contented followers.go you and prepare aliena;for,look you,here comes my rosalind.god save you,brother.and you,fair sister.o ! my dear orlando,how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.it is my arm.i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.wounded it is,but with the eyes of a lady.did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swound when he showed me your handkercher ?ay,and greater wonders than that.o ! i know where you are.nay,\\'tis true : there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams,and c sar\\'s thrasonical brag of \\'i came,saw,and overcame :\\' for your brother and my sister no sooner met,but they looked;no sooner looked but they loved;no sooner loved but they sighed;no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason;no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy : and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent,or else be incontinent before marriage.they are in the very wrath of love,and they will together : clubs cannot part them.they shall be married to-morrow,and i will bid the duke to the nuptial.but,o ! how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man\\'s eyes.by so much the more shall i to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness,by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.why then,to-morrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind ?i can live no longer by thinking.i will weary you then no longer with idle talking.know of me then,for now i speak to some purpose,that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit.i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge,insomuch i say i know you are;neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you,to do yourself good,and not to grace me.believe then,if you please,that i can do strange things.i have,since i was three years old,conversed with a magician,most profound in his art and yet not damnable.if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out,when your brother marries aliena,shall you marry her.i know into what straits of fortune she is driven;and it is not impossible to me,if it appear not inconvenient to you,to set her before your eyes to-morrow,human as she is,and without any danger.speakest thou in sober meanings ?by my life,i do;which i tender dearly,though i say i am a magician.therefore,put you in your best array;bid your friends;for if you will be married to-morrow,you shall;and to rosalind,if you will.look,here comes a lover of mine,and a lover of hers.youth,you have done me much ungentleness,to show the letter that i writ to you.i care not if i have : it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you.you are there follow\\'d by a faithful shepherd :look upon him,love him;he worships you.good shepherd,tell this youth what \\'tis to love.it is to be all made of sighs and tears;and so am i for phebe.and i for ganymede.and i for rosalind.and i for no woman.it is to be all made of faith and service;and so am i for phebe.and i for ganymede.and i for rosalind.and i for no woman.it is to be all made of fantasy,all made of passion,and all made of wishes;all adoration,duty,and observance;all humbleness,all patience,and impatience;all purity,all trial,all obeisance;and so am i for phebe.and so am i for ganymede.and so am i for rosalind.and so am i for no woman.if this be so,why blame you me to love you ?if this be so,why blame you me to love you ?if this be so,why blame you me to love you ?who do you speak to,\\'why blame you me to love you ?\\' to her that is not here,nor doth not hear.pray you,no more of this : \\'tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon.as you love phebe,meet : and as i love no woman,i\\'ll meet.so,fare you well : i have left you commands.i\\'ll not fail,if i live.nor i.nor i.to-morrow is the joyful day,audrey;to-morrow will we be married.i do desire it with all my heart,and i hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.here come two of the banished duke\\'s pages.well met,honest gentleman.by my troth,well met.come,sit,sit,and a song.we are for you : sit i\\' the middle.shall we clap into\\'t roundly,without hawking or spitting,or saying we are hoarse,which are the only prologues to a bad voice ?i\\'faith,i\\'faith;and both in a tune,like two gipsies on a horse.it was a lover and his lass,with a hey,and a ho,and a hey nonino,that o\\'er the green corn-field did pass,in the spring time,the only pretty ring time,when birds do sing,hey ding a ding,ding;sweet lovers love the spring.between the acres of the rye,with a hey,and a ho,and a hey nonino,these pretty country folks would lie,in the spring time,&c.this carol they began that hour,with a hey,and a ho,and a hey nonino,how that a life was but a flower in the spring time,&c.and therefore take the present time,with a hey,and a ho,and a hey nonino;for love is crowned with the prime in the spring time,&c.truly,young gentlemen,though there was no great matter in the ditty,yet the note was very untuneable.you are deceived,sir : we kept time;we lost not our time.by my troth,yes;i count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song.god be wi\\' you;and god mend your voices ! come,audrey.dost thou believe,orlando,that the boy can do all this that he hath promised ?i sometimes do believe,and sometimes do not;as those that fear they hope,and know they fear.patience once more,whiles our compact is urg\\'d.you say,if i bring in your rosalind,you will bestow her on orlando here ?that would i,had i kingdoms to give with her.and you say,you will have her when i bring her ?that would i,were i of all kingdoms king.you say,that you\\'ll marry me,if i be willing ?that will i,should i die the hour after.but if you do refuse to marry me,you\\'ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?so is the bargain.you say,that you\\'ll have phebe,if she will ?though to have her and death were both one thing.i have promis\\'d to make all this matter even.keep you your word,o duke,to give your daughter;you yours,orlando,to receive his daughter;keep your word,phebe,that you\\'ll marry me,or else,refusing me,to wed this shepherd;keep your word,silvius,that you\\'ll marry her,if she refuse me : and from hence i go,to make these doubts all even.i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter\\'s favour.my lord,the first time that i ever saw him,methought he was a brother to your daughter;but,my good lord,this boy is forest-born,and hath been tutor\\'d in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle,whom he reports to be a great magician,obscured in the circle of this forest.there is,sure,another flood toward,and these couples are coming to the ark.here comes a pair of very strange beasts,which in all tongues are called fools.salutation and greeting to you all !good my lord,bid him welcome.this is the motley-minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest : he hath been a courtier,he swears.if any man doubt that,let him put me to my purgation.i have trod a measure;i have flattered a lady;i have been politic with my friend,smooth with mine enemy;i have undone three tailors;i have had four quarrels,and like to have fought one.and how was that ta\\'en up ?faith,we met,and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.how seventh cause ? good my lord,like this fellow.i like him very well.god \\'ild you,sir;i desire you of the like.i press in here,sir,amongst the rest of the country copulatives,to swear,and to forswear,according as marriage binds and blood breaks.a poor virgin,sir,an ill-favoured thing,sir,but mine own : a poor humour of mine,sir,to take that that no man else will.rich honesty dwells like a miser,sir,in a poor house,as your pearl in your foul oyster.by my faith,he is very swift and sententious.according to the fool\\'s bolt,sir,and such dulcet diseases.but,for the seventh cause;how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?upon a lie seven times removed :bear your body more seeming,audrey :as thus,sir.i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier\\'s beard : he sent me word,if i said his beard was not cut well,he was in the mind it was : this is called \\'the retort courteous.\\' if i sent him word again,it was not well cut,he would send me word,he cut it to please himself : this is called the \\'quip modest.\\' if again,it was not well cut,he disabled my judgment : this is called the \\'reply churlish.\\' if again,it was not well cut,he would answer,i spake not true : this is called the \\'reproof valiant :\\' if again,it was not well cut,he would say,i lie : this is called the \\'countercheck quarrelsome\\' : and so to the \\'lie circumstantial,\\' and the \\'lie direct.\\' and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?i durst go no further than the \\'lie circumstantial,\\' nor he durst not give me the \\'lie direct;\\' and so we measured swords and parted.can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie ?o sir,we quarrel in print;by the book,as you have books for good manners : i will name you the degrees.the first,the \\'retort courteous;\\' the second,the \\'quip modest;\\' the third,the \\'reply churlish;\\' the fourth,the \\'reproof valiant;\\' the fifth,the \\'countercheck quarrelsome;\\' the sixth,the \\'lie with circumstance;\\' the seventh,the \\'lie direct.\\' all these you may avoid but the lie direct;and you may avoid that too,with an \\'if.\\' i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel;but when the parties were met themselves,one of them thought but of an \\'if,\\' as \\'if you said so,then i said so;\\' and they shook hands and swore brothers.your \\'if\\' is the only peace-maker;much virtue in \\'if.\\' is not this a rare fellow,my lord ? he\\'s as good at any thing,and yet a fool.he uses his folly like a stalking-horse,and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.then is there mirth in heaven,when earthly things made even atone together.good duke,receive thy daughter;hymen from heaven brought her;yea,brought her hither,that thou mightst join her hand with his,whose heart within her bosom is.to you i give myself,for i am yours.to you i give myself,for i am yours.if there be truth in sight,you are my daughter.if there be truth in sight,you are my rosalind.if sight and shape be true,why then,my love adieu !i\\'ll have no father,if you be not he.i\\'ll have no husband,if you be not he :nor ne\\'er wed woman,if you be not she.peace,ho ! i bar confusion :\\'tis i must make conclusion of these most strange events :here\\'s eight that must take hands to join in hymen\\'s bands,if truth holds true contents.you and you no cross shall part :you and you are heart in heart :you to his love must accord,or have a woman to your lord :you and you are sure together,as the winter to foul weather.whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,feed yourselves with questioning,that reason wonder may diminish,how thus we met,and these things finish.wedding is great juno\\'s crown :o blessed bond of board and bed !\\'tis hymen peoples every town;high wedlock then be honoured.honour,high honour,and renown,to hymen,god of every town !o my dear niece ! welcome thou art to me :even daughter,welcome in no less degree.i will not eat my word,now thou art mine;thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.let me have audience for a word or two :i am the second son of old sir rowland,that bring these tidings to this fair assembly.'"

too high to be enthrall d to low or else misgraffed in respect of years o spite   too old to be engag d to young or else it stood upon the choice of friends o hell   to choose love by another s eye or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a

vain as in revenge have suck d up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents  the ox hath therefore stretch d his yoke in vain the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain d a beard  the fold stands empty in the drowned field and crows are fatted with the murrion flock the nine men s morris is fill d up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable  the human mortals want their winter here  no night is now with hymn or carol blest  therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound  and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter   hoary headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems  thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazed world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evil comes from our debate from our dissension  we are their parents and original do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon  i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman set your heart at rest the fairy land buys not the child of me his mother was a votaress of my order  and in the spiced indian air by night full often hath she gossip d by my side and sat with me on neptune s yellow sands marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laugh d to see the sails conceive and grow big bellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake i do rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him how long within this wood intend you stay  perchance till after theseus  weddingday if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts give me that boy and i will go with thee not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away  we shall chide downright if i longer stay well go thy way   thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury my gentle puck come hither thou remember st since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea maid s music i remember that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all arm d   a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west and loos d his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupid s fiery shaft quench d in the chaste beams of the wat ry moon and the imperial votaress passed on in maiden meditation fancy free yet mark d i where the bolt of cupid fell  it fell upon a little western flower before milk white now purple with love s wound and maidens call it love in idleness fetch me that flower the herb i show d thee once  the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league i ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes having once this juice i ll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes  the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love  and ere i take this charm off from her sight as i can take it with another herb i ll make her render up her page to me but who comes here   i am invisible and i will overhear their conference i love thee not therefore pursue me not where is lysander and fair hermia  the one i ll slay the other slayeth me thou told st me they were stol n into this wood and here am i and wood within this wood because i cannot meet my hermia hence   get thee gone and follow me no more you draw me you hard hearted adamant  but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel   leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you do i entice you   do i speak you fair  or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you  and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you  use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be used as you use your dog  tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on you and i am sick when i look not on you you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity your virtue is my privilege   for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world  then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me  i ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts the wildest hath not such a heart as you run when you will the story shall be chang d apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger   bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valour flies i will not stay thy questions   let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief fie demetrius  your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we cannot fight for love as men may do we should be woo d and were not made to woo i ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well fare thee well nymph   ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love hast thou the flower there   welcome wanderer ay there it is i pray thee give it me i know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite over canopied with luscious woodbine with sweet musk roses and with eglantine  there sleeps titania some time of the night lull d in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enamell d skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in  and with the juice of this i ll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies take thou some of it and seek through this grove  a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth   anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow fear not my lord your servant shall do so come now a roundel and a fairy song then for the third of a minute hence some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds some war with rere mice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep then to your offices and let me rest the fairies sing i you spotted snakes with double tongue thorny hedge hogs be not seen newts and blind worms do no wrong come not near our fairy queen philomel with melody sing in our sweet lullaby  lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby  never harm nor spell nor charm come

bristled hair in thy eye that shall appear when thou wak st it is thy dear wake when some vile thing is near fair love you faint with wandering in the wood and to speak troth i have forgot our way  we ll rest us hermia if you think it good and tarry for the comfort of the day be it so lysander   find you out a bed for i upon this bank will rest my head one turf shall serve as pillow for us both one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth nay good lysander for my sake my dear lie further off yet do not lie so near o   take the sense sweet of my innocence love takes the meaning in love s conference i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it two bosoms interchained with an oath so then two bosoms and a single troth then by your side no bed room me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie lysander riddles very prettily  now much beshrew my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid so far be distant and good night sweet friend thy love ne er alter till thy sweet life end  amen amen to that fair prayer say i and then end life when i end loyalty  here is my bed   sleep give thee all his rest  with half that wish the wisher s eyes be press d  through the forest have i gone but athenian found i none on whose eyes i might approve this flower s force in stirring love night and silence   who is here  weeds of athens he doth wear  this is he my master said despised the athenian maid and here the maiden sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground pretty soul   she durst not lie near this lack love this kill courtesy churl upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe when thou wak st let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid  so awake when i am gone for i must now to oberon stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus o   wilt thou darkling leave me   do not so stay on thy peril   i alone will go o   i am out of breath in this fond chase the more my prayer the lesser is my grace happy is hermia wheresoe er she lies for she hath blessed and attractive eyes how came her eyes so bright   not with salt tears  if so my eyes are oftener wash d than hers no no i am as ugly as a bear for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do as a monster fly my presence thus what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia s sphery eyne  but who is here   lysander   on the ground  dead   or asleep   i see no blood no wound lysander if you live good sir awake and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake transparent helena   nature shows art that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart where is demetrius   o   how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword do not say so lysander say not so what though he love your hermia   lord   what though  yet hermia still loves you   then be content content with hermia   no   i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent not hermia but helena i love  who will not change a raven for a dove  the will of man is by his reason sway d and reason says you are the worthier maid things growing are not ripe until their season so i being young till now ripe not to reason and touching now the point of human skill reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes where i o erlook love s stories written in love s richest book wherefore was i to this keen mockery born  when at your hands did i deserve this scorn  is t not enough is t not enough young man that i did never no nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius  eye but you must flout my insufficiency  good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do in such disdainful manner me to woo but fare you well   perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness o   that a lady of one man refus d should of another therefore be abus d she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings or as the heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive  so thou my surfeit and my heresy of all be hated but the most of me  and all my powers address your love and might to honour helen and to be her knight help me lysander help me   do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast ay me for pity   what a dream was here  lysander look how i do quake with fear  methought a serpent eat my heart away and you sat smiling at his cruel prey lysander   what   remov d  lysander   lord  what   out of hearing   gone   no sound no word  alack   where are you   speak an if you hear speak of all loves   i swound almost with fear no   then i well perceive you are not nigh  either death or you i ll find immediately are we all met  pat pat and here s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal this green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiring house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke peter quince what sayst thou bully bottom  there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisby that will never please first pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide how answer you that  by r lakin a parlous fear i believe we must leave the killing out when all is done not a whit   i have a device to make all well write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver   this will put them out of fear well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six no make it two more   let it be written in eight and eight will not the ladies be afeard of the lion  i fear it i promise you masters you ought to consider with yourselves   to bring in god shield us  a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wild fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to it therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion s neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect  ladies   or  fair ladies    i would wish you   or  i would request you   or  i would entreat you not to fear not to tremble   my life for yours if you think i come hither as a lion it were pity of my life   no i am no such thing   i am a man as other men are   and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner well it shall be so but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know pyramus and thisby meet by moonlight doth the moon shine that night we play our play  a calendar a calendar   look in the almanack find out moonshine find out moonshine yes it doth shine that night why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine then there is another thing   we must have a wall in the great chamber for pyramus and thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wall you can never bring in a wall what say you bottom  some man or other must present wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisby whisper if that may be than all is well come sit down every mother s son and rehearse your parts pyramus you begin   when you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so every one according to his cue what hempen home spuns have we swaggering here so near the cradle of the fairy queen  what   a play toward i ll be an auditor an actor too perhaps if i see cause speak pyramus thisby stand forth thisby the flowers have odious savours sweet odorous odorous odours savours sweet  so hath thy breath my dearest thisby dear but hark a voice   stay thou but here awhile and by and by i will to thee appear a stranger pyramus than e er play d here  must i speak now  ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again most radiant pyramus most lily white of hue of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely jew as true as truest horse that yet would never tire i ll meet thee pyramus at ninny s tomb  ninus  tomb   man why you must not speak that yet that you answer to pyramus   you speak all your part at once cues and all pyramus enter   your cue is past it is  never tire   o  as true as truest horse that yet would never tire if i were fair thisby i were only thine o monstrous   o strange   we are haunted pray masters   fly masters  help  i ll follow you i ll lead you about a round through bog through bush through brake through brier  sometime a horse i ll be sometime a hound a hog a headless bear sometime a fire and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn why do they run away   this is a knavery of them to make me afeard o bottom thou art changed   what do i see on thee  what do you see   you see an ass head of your own do you  bless thee bottom   bless thee   thou art translated i see their knavery   this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could but i will not stir from this place do what they can   i will walk up and down here and i will sing that they shall hear i am not afraid the ousel cock so black of hue with orange tawny bill the throstle with his note so true the wren with little quill what angel wakes me from my flowery bed  the finch the sparrow and the lark the plain song cuckoo gray whose note full many a man doth mark and dares not answer nay for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird   who would give a bird the lie though he cry  cuckoo  never so  i pray thee gentle mortal sing again  mine ear is much enamour d of thy note so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape and thy fair virtue s force perforce doth move me on the first view to say to swear i love thee methinks mistress you should have little reason for that   and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together now a days the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends nay i can gleek upon occasion thou art as wise as thou art beautiful not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn out of this wood do not desire to go  thou shalt remain here whe r thou wilt or no i am a spirit of no common rate the summer still doth tend upon my state and i do love thee   therefore go with me i ll give thee fairies to attend on thee and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep  and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go pease blossom   cobweb   moth   and mustardseed  ready and i and i and i where shall we go  be kind and courteous to this gentleman hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes feed him with apricocks and dewberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries the honey bags steal from the humble bees and for night tapers crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery glow worm s eyes to have my love to bed and to arise and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes  nod to him elves and do him courtesies hail mortal  hail  hail  hail  i cry your worships mercy heartily   i beseech your worship s name cobweb i shall desire you of more acquaintance good master cobweb   if i out my finger i shall make bold with you your name honest gentleman  pease blossom i pray you commend me to mistress squash your mother and to master peascod your father good master pease blossom i shall desire you of more acquaintance too your name i beseech you sir  mustard seed good master mustard seed i know your patience well   that same cowardly giant like ox beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house i promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now i desire you of more acquaintance good master mustard seed come wait upon him lead him to my bower the moon methinks looks with a watery eye and when she weeps weeps every little flower lamenting some enforced chastity tie up my love s tongue bring him silently i wonder if titania be awak d then what it was that next came in her eye which she must dote on in extremity here comes my messenger how now mad spirit  what night rule now about this haunted grove  my mistress with a monster is in love near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus  nuptial day the shallowest thick skin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enter d in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an ass s nowl i fixed on his head  anon his thisbe must be answered and forth my mimick comes when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russet pated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the gun s report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here o er and o er one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania wak d and straightway lov d an ass this falls out better than i could devise but hast thou yet latch d the athenian s eyes with the love juice as i did bid thee do  i took him sleeping that is finish d too and the athenian woman by his side that when he wak d of force she must be ey d stand close   this is the same athenian this is the woman but not this the man o   why rebuke you him that loves you so  lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being o er shoes in blood plunge in knee deep and kill me too the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stol n away from sleeping hermia   i ll believe as soon this whole earth may be bor d and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brother s noontide with the antipodes it cannot be but thou hast murder d him so should a murderer look so dead so grim so should the murder d look and so should i pierc d through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere what s this to my lysander   where is he  ah   good demetrius wilt thou give him me  i had rather give his carcass to my hounds out dog   out cur   thou driv st me past the bounds of maiden s patience hast thou slain him then  henceforth be never number d among men  o   once tell true tell true e en for my sake durst thou have look d upon him being awake and hast thou kill d him sleeping   o brave touch  could not a worm an adder do so much  an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung you spend your passion on a mispris d mood  i am not guilty of lysander s blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell i pray thee tell me then that he is well an if i could what should i get therefore  a privilege never to see me more and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whe r he be dead or no there is no following her in this fierce vein  here therefore for awhile i will remain so sorrow s heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay what hast thou done   thou hast mistaken quite and laid the love juice on some true love s sight  of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turn d and not a false turn d true then fate o er rules that one man holding troth a million fail confounding oath on oath about the wood go swifter than the wind and helena of athens look thou find  all fancy sick she is and pale of cheer with sighs of love that cost the fresh blood dear by some illusion see thou bring her here  i ll charm his eyes against she do appear i go i go look how i go swifter than arrow from the tartar s bow flower of this purple dye hit with cupid s archery sink in apple of his eye when his love he doth espy let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky when thou wak st if she be by beg of her for remedy captain of our fairy band helena is here at hand and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover s fee shall we their fond pageant see  lord what fools these mortals be  stand aside   the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake then will two at once woo one that must needs be sport alone and those things do best please me that befall preposterously why should you think that i should woo in scorn  scorn and derision never come in tears  look when i vow i weep and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears how can these things in me seem scorn to you bearing the badge of faith to prove them true  you do advance your cunning more and more when truth kills truth o devilish holy fray  these vows are hermia s   will you give her o er  weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh  your vows to her and me put in two scales will even weigh and both as light as tales i had no judgment when to her i swore nor none in my mind now you give her o er demetrius loves her and he loves not you o helen   goddess nymph perfect divine  to what my love shall i compare thine eyne  crystal is muddy o   how ripe in show thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow this pure congealed white high taurus  snow fann d with the eastern wind turns to a crow when thou hold st up thy hand o   let me kiss that princess of pure white this seal of bliss o spite   o hell   i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment  if you were civil and knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too  if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena  a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maid s eyes with your derision   none of noble sort would so offend a virgin and extort a poor soul s patience all to make you sport you are unkind demetrius be not so for you love hermia this you know i know  and here with all good will with all my heart in hermia s love i yield you up my part and yours of helena to me bequeath whom i do love and will do to my death never did mockers waste more idle breath lysander keep thy hermia i will none  if e er i lov d her all that love is gone my heart with her but as guest wise sojourn d and now to helen it is home return d there to remain helen it is not so disparage not the faith thou dost not know lest to thy peril thou aby it dear look   where thy love comes   yonder is thy dear dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so  why should he stay whom love doth press to go  what love could press lysander from my side  lysander s love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light why seek st thou me   could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so  you speak not as you think   it cannot be lo   she is one of this confederacy now i perceive they have conjoin d all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me injurious hermia   most ungrateful maid  have you conspir d have you with these contriv d to bait me with this foul derision  is all the counsel that we two have shar d the sister vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty footed time for parting us o   is it all forgot  all school days  friendship childhood innocence  we hermia like two artificial gods have with our neelds created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate so we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crowned with one crest and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend  it is not friendly  tis not maidenly  our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury i am amazed at your passionate words i scorn you not   it seems that you scorn me have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial   wherefore speaks he this to her he hates   and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent  what though i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unlov d  this you should pity rather than despise i understand not what you mean by this ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up  this sport well carried shall be chronicled if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument but fare ye well    tis partly mine own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy stay gentle helena   hear my excuse  my love my life my soul fair helena  o excellent  sweet do not scorn her so if she cannot entreat i can compel thou canst compel no more than she entreat  thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers helen i love thee by my life i do  i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not i say i love thee more than he can do if thou say so withdraw and prove it too quick come  lysander whereto tends all this  away you ethiop  no no he ll   seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not   you are a tame man go  hang off thou cat thou burr   vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent why are you grown so rude   what change is this sweet love thy love   out tawny tartar out  out loathed medicine   hated poison hence  do you not jest  yes sooth and so do you demetrius i will keep my word with thee i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you   i ll not trust your word what   should i hurt her strike her kill her dead  although i hate her i ll not harm her so what   can you do me greater harm than hate  hate me   wherefore   o me   what news my love  am not i hermia   are not you lysander  i am as fair now as i was erewhile since night you lov d me yet since night you left me  why then you left me o the gods forbid  in earnest shall i say  ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more therefore be out of hope of question doubt be certain nothing truer    tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena o me   you juggler   you canker blossom  you thief of love   what   have you come by night and stol n my love s heart from him  fine i  faith  have you no modesty no maiden shame no touch of bashfulness   what   will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue  fie fie   you counterfeit you puppet you  puppet   why so   ay that way goes the game now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures   she hath urg d her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevail d with him and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low  how low am i thou painted maypole   speak how low am i   i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes i pray you though you mock me gentlemen let her not hurt me   i was never curst i have no gift at all in shrewishness i am a right maid for my cowardice  let her not strike me you perhaps may think because she is something lower than myself that i can match her lower   hark again good hermia do not be so bitter with me i evermore did love you hermia did ever keep your counsels never wrong d you save that in love unto demetrius i told him of your stealth unto this wood he follow d you for love i follow d him but he hath chid me hence and threaten

wrong and sometime rail thou like demetrius and from each other look thou lead them thus till o er their brows death counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep  then crush this herb into lysander s eye whose liquor hath this virtuous property to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight when they next wake all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision and back to athens shall the lovers wend with league whose date till death shall never end whiles i in this affair do thee employ i ll to my queen and beg her indian boy and then i will her charmed eye release from monster s view and all things shall be peace my fairy lord this must be done with haste for night s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast and yonder

i love thee how i dote on thee  welcome good robin see st thou this sweet sight  her dotage now i do begin to pity  for meeting her of late behind the wood seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flowerets  eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms begg d my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes  and gentle puck take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this night s accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream but first i will release the fairy queen be as thou wast wont to be see as thou wast wont to see  dian s bud o er cupid s flower hath such force and blessed power now my

house triumphantly and bless it to all fair prosperity there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded with theseus all in jollity fairy king attend and mark  i do hear the morning lark then my queen in silence sad trip we after the night s shade we the globe can compass soon swifter than the wandering moon come my lord and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground go one of you find out the forester for now our observation is perform d and since we have the vaward of the day my love shall hear the music of my hounds uncouple in the western valley let them go  dispatch i say and find the forester we will fair queen up to the mountain s top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bay d the bear with hounds of sparta   never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seem d all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flew d so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crook knee d and dew lapp d like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but match d in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tuneable was never holla d to nor cheer d with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly  judge when you hear but soft   what nymphs are these  my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedar s helena  i wonder of their being here together no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace of our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice  it is my lord go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns good morrow friends saint valentine is past  begin these wood birds but to couple now  pardon my lord i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies  how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity  my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking   but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i think for truly would i speak and now i do bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither   our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law enough enough my lord you have enough  i beg the law the law upon his head they would have stol n away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wife my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither follow d them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it is my love to hermia melted as doth the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betroth d ere i saw hermia  but like in sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now do i wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it fair lovers you are fortunately met  of this discourse we more will hear anon egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit  and for the morning now is something worn our purpos d hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens   three and three we ll hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta these things seem small and undistinguishable like far off mountains turned into clouds methinks i see these things with parted eye when everything seems double so methinks  and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own are you sure that we are awake   it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do you not think the duke was here and bid us follow him  yea and my father and hippolyta and he did bid us follow to the temple why then we are awake let s follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams when my cue comes call me and i will answer   my next is  most fair pyramus   heigh ho   peter quince   flute the bellows mender   snout the tinker   starveling   god s my life   stolen hence and left me asleep   i have had a most rare vision i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was   man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream methought i was there is no man can tell what methought i was and methought i had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man s hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream   it shall be called bottom s dream because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke   peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death have you sent to bottom s house   is he come home yet  he cannot be heard of out of doubt he is transported if he come not then the play is marred   it goes not forward doth it  it is not possible   you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice you must say  paragon    a paramour is god bless us   a thing of naught masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married   if our sport had gone forward we had all been made men o sweet bully bottom   thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have  scaped sixpence a day   an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus i ll be hanged he would have deserved it   sixpence a day in pyramus or nothing where are these lads   where are these hearts  bottom   o most courageous day   o most happy hour  masters i am to discourse wonders   but ask me not what for if i tell you i am no true athenian i will tell you everything right as it fell out let us hear sweet bottom not a word of me all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred in any case let thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion s claws and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy no more words   away   go away  tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact  one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helen s beauty in a brow of egypt  the poet s eye in a fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poet s pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush suppos d a bear  but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigur d so together more witnesseth than fancy s images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable here come the lovers full of joy and mirth joy gentle friends   joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts  more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed  come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after supper and bed time  where is our usual manager of mirth  what revels are in hand   is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour  call philostrate here mighty theseus say what abridgment have you for this evening  what masque   what music   how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight  there is a brief how many sports are ripe make choice of which your highness will see first the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp we ll none of that   that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was play d when i from thebes came last a conqueror the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceas d in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical   tedious and brief  that is hot ice and wonderous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord  a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted and tragical my noble lord it is for pyramus therein doth kill himself which when i saw rehears d i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed what are they that do play it  hard handed men that work in athens here which never labour d in their minds till now and now have toil d their unbreath d memories with this same play against your nuptial and we will hear it no my noble lord it is not for you   i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretch d and conn d with cruel pain to do you service i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in   and take your places ladies i love not to see wretchedness o ercharg d and duty in his service perishing why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing he says they can do nothing in this kind the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake  and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practis d accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pick d a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tongue tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity so please your grace the prologue is address d let him approach if we offend it is with our good will that you should think we come not to offend but with good will to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end consider then we come but in despite we do not come as minding to content you our true intent is all for your delight we are not here that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know this fellow doth not stand upon points he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord   it is not enough to speak but to speak true indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next  gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisby is certain this man with lime and rough cast doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through wall s chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus  tomb there there to woo this grisly beast which lion hight by name the trusty thisby coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fied her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisby s mantle slain  whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broach d his boiling bloody breast and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain i wonder if the lion be to speak no wonder my lord   one lion may when many asses do wall in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisby did whisper often very secretly this loam this rough cast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper would you desire lime and hair to speak better  it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord pyramus draws near the wall   silence  o grim look d night   o night with hue so black  o night which ever art when day is not  o night   o night   alack alack alack  i fear my thisby s promise is forgot and thou o wall   o sweet o lovely wall  that stand st between her father s ground and mine thou wall o wall   o sweet and lovely wall  show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne thanks courteous wall   jove shield thee well for this  but what see i   no thisby do i see o wicked wall   through whom i see no bliss curs d be thy stones for thus deceiving me  the wall methinks being sensible should curse again no in truth sir he should not  deceiving me   is thisby s cue   she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes o wall   full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me  my cherry lips have often kiss d thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee i see a voice   now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisby s face thisby my love   thou art my love i think think what thou wilt i am thy lover s grace and like limander am i trusty still and i like helen till the fates me kill not shafalus to procrus was so true as shafalus to procrus i to you o   kiss me through the hole of this vile wall i kiss the wall s hole not your lips at all wilt thou at ninny s tomb meet me straightway   tide life  tide death i come without delay thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go now is the mural down between the two neighbours no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them it must be your imagination then and not theirs if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar then know that i one snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lion s dam  for if i should as lion come in strife into this place  twere pity on my life a very gentle beast and of a good conscience the very best at a beast my lord that e er i saw this lion is a very fox for his valour true and a goose for his discretion not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well   leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon this lanthorn doth the horned moon present he should have worn the horns on his head he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference this lanthorn doth the horned moon present myself the man i  the moon do seem to be this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn   how is it else the man i  the moon  he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff i am aweary of this moon   would he would change  it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time proceed moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon i the man in the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence   here comes thisbe this is old ninny s tomb where is my love  oh well roared lion well run thisbe well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace well moused lion and then came pyramus and so the lion vanished sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering streams i trust to taste of truest thisby s sight but stay o spite  but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here  eyes do you see  how can it be  o dainty duck   o dear  thy mantle good what   stain d with blood  approach ye furies fell  o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail crush conclude and quell  this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad beshrew my heart but i pity the man o   wherefore nature didst thou lions frame  since lion vile hath here deflower d my dear  which is no no which was the fairest dame that liv d that lov d that lik d that look d with cheer come tears confound out sword and wound the pap of pyramus  ay that left pap where heart doth hop  thus die i thus thus thus now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky  tongue lose thy light  moon take thy flight  now die die die die die no die but an ace for him for he is but one less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover  she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus   i hope she will be brief a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better   he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes and thus she moans videlicet  asleep my love  what dead my dove  o pyramus arise  speak speak   quite dumb  dead dead   a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes these lily lips this cherry nose these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone are gone  lovers make moan  his eyes were green as leeks o sisters three come come to me with hands as pale as milk lay them in gore since you have shore with shears his thread of silk tongue not a word  come trusty sword  come blade my breast imbrue  and farewell friends thus thisby ends  adieu adieu adieu moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead ay and wall too no i assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company  no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe s garter it would have been a fine tragedy   and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask   let your epilogue alone the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed  tis almost fairy time i fear we shall out sleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatch d this palpable gross play hath well beguil d the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity now the hungry lion roars and the wolf behowls the moon whilst the heavy ploughman snores all with weary task fordone now the wasted brands do glow whilst the screech owl screeching loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the church way paths to glide  and we fairies that do run by the triple hecate s team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallow d house  i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door through the house give glimmering light by the dead and drowsy fire every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly first rehearse your song by rote to each word a warbling note  hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place now until the break of day through this house each fairy stray to the best bride bed will we which by us shall blessed be and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be and the blots of nature s hand shall not in their issue stand  never mole hare lip nor scar nor mark prodigious such as are despised in nativity shall upon their children be with this field dew consecrate every fairy take his gait and each several chamber bless through this palace with sweet peace ever shall in safety rest and the owner of it blest trip away make no stay meet me all by break of day if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumber d here while these visions did appear and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend  if you pardon we will mend and as i m an honest puck if we have unearned luck now to  scape the serpent s tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call  so good night unto you all give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends alls well that ends wellin delivering my son from me i bury a second husband and i in going madam weep o er my father s death anew but i must attend his majesty s command to whom i am now in ward evermore in subjection you shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance what hope is there of his majesty s amendment  he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time this young gentlewoman had a father o that  had    how sad a passage  tis  whose skill was almost as great as his honesty had it stretched so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work would for the king s sake he were living   i think it would be the death of the king s disease how called you the man you speak of madam  he was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so   gerard de narbon he was excellent indeed madam   the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge could be set up against mortality what is it my good lord the king languishes of  a fistula my lord i heard not of it before i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon  his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking i have those hopes of her good that her education promises   her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too   in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness your commendations madam get from her tears  tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek no more of this helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living if the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortal madam i desire your holy wishes how understand we that  be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father in manners as in shape   thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee and thy goodness share with thy birthright   love all trust a few do wrong to none   be able for thine enemy rather in power than use and keep thy friend under thy own life s key   be check d for silence but never tax d for speech what heaven more will that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down fall on thy head   farewell my lord  tis an unseason d courtier good my lord advise him he cannot want the best that shall attend his love heaven bless him   farewell bertram the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you   be comfortable to my mother your mistress and make much of her farewell pretty lady   you must hold the credit of your father o   were that all i think not on my father and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him what was he like  i have forgot him   my imagination carries no favour in t but bertram s i am undone   there is no living none if bertram be away it were all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it he is so above me  in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted not in his sphere the ambition in my love thus plagues itself  the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love  twas pretty though a plague to see him every hour to sit and draw his arched brows his hawking eye his curls in our heart s table heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour  but now he s gone and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques who comes here  one that goes with him   i love him for his sake and yet i know him a notorious liar think him a great way fool solely a coward yet these fix d evils sit so fit in him that they take place when virtue s steely bones look bleak in the cold wind   withal full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly save you fair queen  and you monarch  no and no are you meditating on virginity  ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him  keep him out but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some war like resistance there is none   man sitting down before you will undermine you and blow you up bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up   is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men  virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up   marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your city it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost that you were made of is metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost may be ten times found   by being ever kept it is ever lost  tis too cold a companion   away with t  i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin there s little can be said in t  tis against the rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin   virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of self love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon keep it not you cannot choose but lose by t   out with t   within the year it will make itself two which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse away with t  how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking  let me see   marry ill to like him that ne er it likes  tis a commodity that will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth   off with t while  tis vendible answer the time of request virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable   just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek   and your virginity your old virginity is like one of our french withered pears it looks ill it eats drily marry  tis a withered pear it was formerly better marry yet  tis a withered pear will you anything with it  not my virginity yet there shall your master have a thousand loves a mother and a mistress and a friend a ph nix captain and an enemy a guide a goddess and a sovereign a counsellor a traitress and a dear his humble ambition proud humility his jarring concord and his discord dulcet his faith his sweet disaster with a world of pretty fond adoptious christendoms that blinking cupid gossips now shall he i know not what he shall god send him well  the court s a learning place and he is one what one i  faith  that i wish well  tis pity what s pity  that wishing well had not a body in t which might be felt that we the poorer born whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes might with effects of them follow our friends and show what we alone must think which never returns us thanks monsieur parolles my lord calls for you little helen farewell   if i can remember thee i will think of thee at court monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star under mars i i especially think under mars why under mars  the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars when he was predominant when he was retrograde i think rather why think you so  you go so much backward when you fight that s for advantage so is running away when fear proposes the safety   but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well i am so full of businesses i cannot answer thee acutely i will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier s counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away   farewell when thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee   so farewell our remedies oft in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven   the fated sky gives us free scope only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull what power is it which mounts my love so high that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye  the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be   who ever strove to show her merit that did miss her love  the king s disease my project may deceive me but my intents are fix d and will not leave me the florentines and senoys are by the ears have fought with equal fortune and continue a braving war so  tis reported sir nay  tis most credible   we

make denial his love and wisdom approv d so to your majesty may plead for amplest credence he hath arm d our answer and florence is denied before he comes  yet for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service freely have they leave to stand on either part it well may serve a nursery to our gentry who are sick for breathing and exploit what s he comes here  it is the count rousillon my good

discipled of the bravest   he lasted long but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act it much repairs me to talk of your good father in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe to day in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awak d them and his honour clock to itself knew the true minute when exception bid him speak and at this time his tongue obey d his hand   who were below him he us

follow d well would demonstrate them now but goers backward his good remembrance sir lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech would i were with him   he would always say methinks i hear him now   his plausive words he scatter d not in ears but grafted them to grow there and to bear  let me not live   thus his good melancholy oft began on the catastrophe and heel of pastime when it was out  let me not live   quoth he  after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments whose constancies expire before their fashions   this he wish d  i after him do after him wish too since i nor wax nor honey can bring home i

physician s daughter my wife   disdain rather corrupt me ever   tis only title thou disdain st in her the which i can build up strange is it that our bloods of colour weight and heat pour d all together would quite confound distinction yet stand off in differences so mighty if she be all that is virtuous save what thou dislik st a poor physician s daughter thou dislik st of virtue for the name but do not so  from lowest place when virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by the doer s deed  where great additions swell s and virtue none it is a dropsied honour good alone is good without a name   vileness is so  the property by what it is should go not by the title she is young wise fair in these to nature she s immediate heir and these breed honour   that is honour s scorn which challenges itself as honour s born and is not like the sire   honours thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere word s a slave debosh d on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as oft is dumb where dust and damn d oblivion is the tomb of honour d bones indeed what should be said  if thou canst like this creature as a maid i can create the rest

gracious lord for i submit my fancy to your eyes when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it i find that she which late was in my nobler thoughts most base is now the praised of the king who so ennobled is as  twere born so take her by the hand and tell her she is thine   to whom i promise a counterpoise if not to thy estate a balance more replete i take

pleasure drown the brim what s his will else  that you will take your instant leave o  the king and make this haste as your own good proceeding strengthen d with what apology you think may make it

shall not break your bidding good my lord farewell go thou toward home where i will never come whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum away   and for our flight bravely coragio  so that from point to point now have you heard the fundamental reasons of this war whose great decision hath much blood let forth and more thirsts after holy seems the quarrel upon your grace s part black and fearful on the opposer therefore we marvel much our cousin france would in so just a business shut his bosom against our borrowing prayers good my lord the reasons of our state i cannot yield but like a common and an outward man that the great figure of a council frames by self unable motion   therefore dare not say what i think of it since i have found myself in my incertain grounds to fail as

sing i know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song let me see what he writes and when he means to come i have no mind to isbel since i was at court our old ling and our isbels o  the country are nothing like your old ling and your isbels o  the court   the brains of my cupid s knocked out and i begin to love as an old man loves money with no stomach what have we here

such is his noble purpose and believe t the duke will lay upon him all the honour that good convenience claims return you thither  ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed till i have no wife i have nothing in france  tis bitter find you that there  ay madam  tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his heart was not consenting to nothing in france until he have no wife  there s nothing here that is too good for him but only she and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys might tend upon and call her hourly mistress who was with him  a servant only and a gentleman which i have some time known parolles was it not  ay my good lady he a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness my son corrupts a well derived nature with his inducement indeed good lady the fellow has a deal of that

miseries which nature owes were mine at once no come thou home rousillon whence honour but of danger wins a scar as oft it loses all   i will be gone my being here it is that holds thee hence  shall i

strength but yet we ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake to the extreme edge of hazard then go thou forth and fortune play upon thy prosp rous helm as thy auspicious mistress  this very day great mars i put myself into thy file  make me but like my thoughts and i shall prove a lover of thy drum hater of love alas   and would you take the letter of her  might you not know she would do as she has done by sending me a letter   read it again i am saint jaques  pilgrim thither gone  ambitious love hath so in me offended that bare foot plod i the cold ground upon with sainted vow my faults to have amended write write that from the bloody course of war my dearest master your dear son may hie  bless him at home in peace whilst i from far his name with zealous fervour sanctify  his taken labours bid him me forgive i his despiteful juno sent him forth from courtly friends with camping foes to live where death and danger dog the heels of worth  he is too good and fair for death and me whom i myself embrace to set him free ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words  rinaldo you did never lack advice so much as letting her pass so   had i spoke with her i could have well diverted her intents which thus she hath prevented pardon me madam  if i had given you this at over night she might have been o erta en and yet she writes pursuit would be but vain what angel shall bless this unworthy husband   he cannot thrive unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice write write rinaldo to this unworthy husband of his wife let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light   my greatest grief though little he do feel it set down sharply dispatch the most convenient messenger  when haply he shall hear that she is gone he will return and hope i may that she hearing so much will speed her foot again led hither by pure love which of them both is dearest to me i have no skill in sense to make distinction provide this messenger my heart is heavy and mine age is weak grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak nay come for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight they say the french count has done most honourable service it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander and that with his own hand he slew the duke s brother we have lost our labour they are gone a contrary way   hark   you may know by their trumpets come let s return again and suffice ourselves with the report of it well diana take heed of this french earl   the honour of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as honesty i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion i know that knave hang him   one parolles   a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl beware of them diana their promises enticements oaths tokens and all these engines of lust are not the things they go under   many a maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is example that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade succession but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them i hope i need not to advise you further but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost you shall not need to fear me i hope so look here comes a pilgrim  i know she will lie at my house thither they send one another i ll question her god save you pilgrim   whither are you bound  to saint jaques le grand where do the palmers lodge i do beseech you  at the saint francis here beside the port is this the way  ay marry is t hark you  they come this way if you will tarry holy pilgrim but till the troops come by i will conduct you where you shall be lodg d  the rather for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself is it yourself  if you shall please so pilgrim i thank you and will stay upon your leisure you came i think from france  i did so here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service his name i pray you the count rousillon   know you such a one  but by the ear that hears most nobly of him his face i know not whatsoe er he is he s bravely taken here he stole from france as  tis reported for the king had married him against his liking think you it is so  ay surely mere the truth   i know his lady there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her what s his name  monsieur parolles o   i believe with him in argument of praise or to the worth of the great count himself she is too mean to have her name repeated   all her deserving is a reserved honesty and that i have not heard examin d alas poor lady   tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord ay right good creature wheresoe er she is her heart weighs sadly this young maid might do her a shrewd turn if she pleas d how do you mean  may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose he does indeed and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid  but she is arm d for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence the gods forbid else  so now they come that is antonio the duke s eldest son that escalus which is the frenchman  he that with the plume    tis a most gallant fellow i would he lov d his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier is t not a handsome gentleman  i like him well  tis pity he is not honest yond s that same knave that leads him to these places   were i his lady i would poison that vile rascal which is he  that jack an apes with scarfs why is he melancholy  perchance he s hurt i  the battle lose our drum   well he s shrewdly vexed at something look he has spied us marry hang you  and your courtesy for a ring carrier  the troop is past come pilgrim i will bring you where you shall host   of enjoin d penitents there s four or five to great saint jaques bound already at my house i humbly thank you please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us to night the charge and thanking shall be for me and to requite you further i will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note we ll take your offer kindly nay good my lord put him to t   let him have his way if your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no more in your respect on my life my lord a bubble do you think i am so far deceived in him  believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he s a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship s entertainment it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you i would i knew in what particular action to try him none better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him   such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hood wink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at his examination   if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything o   for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum   he says he has a stratagem for t when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in t and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not john drum s entertainment your inclining cannot be removed here he comes o   for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design   let him fetch off his drum in any hand how now monsieur   this drum sticks sorely in your disposition a pox on t   let it go    tis but a drum  but a drum    is t  but a drum    a drum so lost   there was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers  that was not to be blamed in the command of the service   it was a disaster of war that c sar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command well we cannot greatly condemn our success   some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered it might have been recovered it might but it is not now it is to be recovered but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer i would have that drum or another or hic jacet why if you have a stomach to t monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into its native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit   if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it but you must not now slumber in it i ll about it this evening   and i will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it  i know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt i vow i know thou rt valiant and to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee farewell i love not many words no more than a fish loves water is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do t  you do not know him my lord as we do   certain it is that he will steal himself into a man s favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever after why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto  none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall to night for indeed he is not for your lordship s respect we ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu   when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very night i must go look my twigs   he shall be caught your brother he shall go along with me as t please your lordship   i ll leave you now will i lead you to the house and show you the lass i spoke of but you say she s honest that s all the fault i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her by this same coxcomb that we have i  the wind tokens and letters which she did re send and this is all i have done she s a fair creature will you go see her  with all my heart my lord if you misdoubt me that i am not she i know not how i shall assure you further but i shall lose the grounds i work upon though my estate be fall n i was well born nothing acquainted with these businesses and would not put my reputation now in any staining act nor would i wish you first give me trust the county is my husband and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word and then you cannot by the good aid that i of you shall borrow err in bestowing it i should believe you  for you have show d me that which well approves you re great in fortune take this purse of gold and let me buy your friendly help thus far which i will over pay and pay again when i have found it the county woos your daughter lays down his wanton siege before her beauty resolv d to carry her   let her in fine consent as we ll direct her how  tis best to bear it now his important blood will nought deny that she ll demand   a ring the county wears that down ward hath succeeded in his house from son to son some four or five descents since the first father wore it   this ring he holds in most rich choice yet in his idle fire to buy his will it would not seem too dear howe er repented after now i see the bottom of your purpose you see it lawful then it is no more but that your daughter ere she seems as won desires this ring appoints him an encounter in fine delivers me to fill the time herself most chastely absent after this to marry her i ll add three thousand crowns to what is past already i have yielded instruct my daughter how she shall persever that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs compos d to her unworthiness   it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves for he persists as if his life lay on t why then to night let us assay our plot which if it speed is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act where both not sin and yet a sinful fact but let s about it he can come no other way but by this hedge corner when you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will   though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter good captain let me be the interpreter art not acquainted with him   knows he not thy voice  no sir i warrant you but what linsey woolsey hast thou to speak to us again  even such as you speak to me he must think us some band of strangers i  the adversary s entertainment now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose   chough s language gabble enough and good enough as for you interpreter you must seem very politic but couch ho   here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges ten o clock   within these three hours  twill be time enough to go home what shall i say i have done   it must be a very plausive invention that carries it they begin to smoke me and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door i find my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my tongue this is the first truth that e er thine own tongue was guilty of what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing i had no such purpose   i must give myself some hurts and say i got them in exploit yet slight ones will not carry it   they will say  came you off with so little    and great ones i dare not give wherefore what s the instance   tongue i must put you into a butter woman s mouth and buy myself another of bajazet s mute if you prattle me into these perils is it possible he should know what he is and be that he is

just how he would woo as if she sat in  s heart she says all men have the like oaths   he had sworn to marry me when his wife s dead therefore i ll lie with him when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid marry that will i live and die a maid  only in this disguise i think t no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win you have not given him his mother s letter  i have delivered it an hour since   there is something in t that stings his nature for on the reading it he changed almost into another man he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you when you have spoken it  tis dead and i am the grave of it he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour   he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition now god delay our rebellion   as we are ourselves what things are we  merely our own traitors   and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o erflows himself is it not most damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents   we shall not then have his company to night  not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour that approaches apace   i would gladly have him see his company anatomized that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit we will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the other in the meantime what near you of these wars  i hear there is an overture of peace nay i assure you a peace concluded what will count rousillon do then   will he travel higher or return again into france  i perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his council let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal of his act sir his wife some two months since fled from his house   her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven how is this justified  the stronger part of it by her own letters which make her story true even to the point of her death   her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place hath the count all this intelligence  ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity i am heartily sorry that he ll be glad of this how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses  and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears   the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together   our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues how now   where s your master  he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave   his lordship will next morning for france the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king they shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commend they cannot be too sweet for the king s tartness here s his lordship now how now my lord   is t not after midnight  i have to night dispatched sixteen businesses a month s length a piece by an abstract of success   i have conge d with the duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourned for her writ to my lady mother i am returning entertained my convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs   the last was the greatest but that i have not ended yet if the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship i mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier   come bring forth this counterfeit model   he has deceived me like a double meaning prophesier bring him forth has sat i  the stocks all night poor gallant knave no matter his heels have deserved it in usurping his spurs so long how does he carry himself  i have told your lordship already the stocks carry him but to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk   he hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i  the stocks   and what think you he hath confessed  nothing of me has a   his confession is taken and it shall be read to his face   if your lordship be in t as i believe you are you must have the patience to hear it a plague upon him   muffled   he can say nothing of me   hush   hush  hoodman comes   porto tartarossa he calls for the tortures   what will you say without  em  i will confess what i know without constraint   if ye pinch me like a pasty i can say no more bosko chimurcho boblibindo chicurmurco you are a merciful general our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note and truly as i hope to live first demand of him how many horse the duke is strong what say you to that  five or six thousand but very weak and unserviceable   the troops are all scattered and the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation and credit and as i hope to live shall i set down your answer so  do   i ll take the sacrament on t how and which way you will all s one to him what a past saving slave is this  you are deceived my lord   this is monsieur parolles the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole theorick of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the chape of his dagger i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly well that s set down five or six thousand horse i said i will say true or thereabouts set down for i ll speak truth he s very near the truth in this but i con him no thanks for t in the nature he delivers it poor rogues i pray you say well that s set down i humbly thank you sir a truth s a truth the rogues are marvellous poor demand of him of what strength they are a foot what say you to that  by my troth sir if i were to live this present hour i will tell true let me see   spurio a hundred and fifty sebastian so many corambus so many jaques so many guiltian cosmo lodowick and gratii two hundred fifty each mine own company chitopher vaumond bentii two hundred fifty each   so that the muster file rotten and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces what shall be done to him  nothing but let him have thanks demand of him my condition and what credit i have with the duke well that s set down you shall demand of him whether one captain dumain be i  the camp a frenchman what his reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty and expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with well weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt what say you to this   what do you know of it  i beseech you let me answer to the particular of the inter gatories   demand them singly do you know this captain dumain  i know him   a  was a botcher s  prentice in paris from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve s fool with child a dumb innocent that could not say him nay nay by your leave hold your hands though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls well is this captain in the duke of florence s camp  upon my knowledge he is and lousy nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your lordship anon what is his reputation with the duke  the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o  the band   i think i have his letter in my pocket marry we ll search in good sadness i do not know   either it is there or it is upon a file with the duke s other letters in my tent here  tis here s a paper shall i read it to you  i do not know if it be it or no our interpreter does it well excellently dian the count s a fool and full of gold that is not the duke s letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence one diana to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish i pray you sir put it up again nay i ll read it first by your favour my meaning in t i protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds damnable both sides rogue  when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it after he scores he never pays the score  half won is match well made match and well make it he ne er pays after debts take it before and say a soldier dian told thee this men are to mell with boys are not to kiss for count of this the count s a fool i know it who pays before but not when he does owe it thine as he vow d to thee in thine ear he shall be whipped through the army with this rime in s forehead this is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier i could endure anything before but a cat and now he s a cat to me i perceive sir by our general s looks we shall be fain to hang you my life sir in any case   not that i am afraid to die but that my offences being many i would repent out the remainder of nature let me live sir in a dungeon i  the stocks or anywhere so i may live we ll see what may be done so you confess freely   therefore once more to this captain dumain you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour   what is his honesty  he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking  em he is stronger than hercules he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine drunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bed clothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw i have but little more to say sir of his honesty   he has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing i begin to love him for this for this description of thine honesty   a pox upon him for me   he is more and more a cat what say you to his expertness in war  faith sir he has led the drum before the english tragedians to belie him i will not and more of his soldiership i know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile end to instruct for the doubling of files   i would do the man what honour i can but of this i am not certain he hath out villained villany so far that the rarity redeems him a pox on him   he s a cat still his qualities being at this poor price i need not ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt sir for a cardecu he will sell the fee simple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually what s his brother the other captain dumain  why does he ask him or me  what s he  e en a crow o  the same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is in a retreat he out runs any lackey marry in coming on he has the cramp if your life be saved will you undertake to betray the florentine  ay and the captain of his horse count rousillon i ll whisper with the general and know his pleasure i ll no more drumming a plague of all drums   only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count have i run into this danger yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken  there is no remedy sir but you must die the general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die come headsman off with his head o lord sir let me live or let me see my death  that shall you and take your leave of all your friends so look about you   know you any here  good morrow noble captain god bless you captain parolles god save you noble captain captain what greeting will you to my lord lafeu   i am for france good captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon   an i were not a very coward i d compel it of you but fare you well you are undone captain all but your scarf that has a knot on t yet who

did lend me which warp d the line of every other favour scorn d a fair colour or express d it stolen extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object   thence it came that she whom all men prais d and whom myself since i have lost have lov d was in mine eye the dust that did offend it well excus d  that thou didst love her strikes some scores away from the great compt but love that comes too late like a remorseful pardon slowly carried to the great sender turns a sour offence crying  that s good that s gone   our rasher faults make trivial price of serious things we have not

marry me either both or none your reputation comes too short for my daughter   you are no husband for her my lord this is a fond and desperate creature whom sometime i have laugh d with   let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them   fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies good my lord ask him upon his oath if he does think he had not my virginity what sayst thou to her  she s impudent my lord and was a common gamester to the camp he does me wrong my lord if i were so he might have bought me at a common price  do not believe him o   behold this ring whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o  the camp if i be one he blushes and  tis it  of six preceding ancestors that gem conferr d by testament to the sequent issue hath it been ow d and worn this is his wife  that ring s a thousand proofs methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it i did my lord but loath am to produce so bad an instrument   his name s parolles i saw the man to day if man he be find him and bring him hither what of him  he s quoted for a most perfidious slave with all the spots of the world tax d and debosh d whose nature sickens but to speak a truth am i or that or this for what he ll utter that will speak anything  she hath that ring of yours i think she has   certain it is i lik d her and boarded her i  the wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancy s course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdued me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at market price have bought i must be patient you that have turn d off a first so noble wife may justly diet me i pray you yet since you lack virtue i will lose a husband send for your ring i will return it home and give me mine again i have it not what ring was yours i pray you  sir much like the same upon your finger know you this ring   this ring was his

feather starts you is this the man you speak of  ay my lord tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you not fearing the displeasure of your master which on your just proceeding i ll keep off by him and by this woman here what know you  so please your majesty my master hath been an honourable gentleman   tricks he hath had in him which gentlemen have come come to the purpose   did he love this woman  faith sir he did love her but how  how i pray you  he did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman how is that  he loved her sir and loved her not as thou art a knave and no knave what an equivocal companion is this  i am a poor man and at your majesty s command he is a good drum my lord but a naughty orator do you know he promised me marriage  faith i know more than i ll speak but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest  yes so please your majesty i did go between them as i said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what   yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of   therefore i will not speak what i know thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married   but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside this ring you say was yours  ay my good lord where did you buy it   or who gave it you  it was not given me nor i did not buy it who lent it you  it was not lent me neither where did you find it then  i found it not if

gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me   he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education this is it adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which i think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i know no wise remedy how

wrestling is good morrow to your worship good monsieur charles what s the new news at the new court  there s no news at the court sir but the old news   that is the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander can you tell if rosalind the duke s daughter be banished with her father  o no for the duke s daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her she is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do where will the old duke live  they say he is already in the forest of arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old robin hood of england they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world what you wrestle to morrow before the new duke  marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a matter i am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall to morrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well your brother is but young and tender and for your love i would be loath to foil him as i must for my own honour if he come in   therefore out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will charles i thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite i had myself notice of my brother s purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute i ll tell thee charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full of ambition an envious emulator of every man s good parts a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother   therefore use thy discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger and thou wert best look to t for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta en thy life by some indirect means or other for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak it there is not one so young and so villanous this day living i speak but brotherly of him but should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder i am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come to morrow i ll give him his payment   if ever he go alone again i ll never wrestle for prize more and so god keep your worship  farewell good charles now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see an end of him for my soul yet i know not why hates nothing more than he yet he s gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that i am altogether misprised but it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all   nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither which now i ll go about i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of and would you yet i were merrier   unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou hadst been still with me i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine   so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee well i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours you know my father hath no child but i nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir   for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce i will render thee again in affection by mine honour i will and when i break that oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet rose my dear rose be merry from henceforth i will coz and devise sports let me see what think you of falling in love  marry i prithee do to make sport withal   but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again what shall be our sport then  let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally i would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women  tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very ill favouredly nay now thou goest from fortune s office to nature s   fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of nature no   when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by fortune fall into the fire   though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument  indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when fortune makes nature s natural the cutter off of nature s wit peradventure this is not fortune s work neither but nature s who perceiving our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses hath sent this natural for our whetstone   for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now wit   whither wander you  mistress you must come away to your father were you made the messenger  no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you where learned you that oath fool  of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught   now i ll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge  ay marry   now unmuzzle your wisdom stand you both forth now   stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave by our beards if we had them thou art by my knavery if i had it then i were but if you swear by that that is not you are not forsworn   no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard prithee who is t that thou meanest  one that old frederick your father loves my father s love is enough to honour him enough   speak no more of him you ll be whipped for taxation one of these days the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly by my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show here comes monsieur le beau with his mouth full of news which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young then we shall be news cramm d all the better we shall be more marketable bon jour monsieur le beau   what s the news  fair princess you have lost much good sport sport   of what colour  what

end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it well the beginning that is dead and buried there comes an old man and his three sons i could match this beginning with an old tale three proper young men of excellent growth and presence with bills on their necks  be it known unto all men by these presents   the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the duke s wrestler which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him   so he served the second and so the third yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping alas  but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost  why this that i speak of thus men may grow wiser every day   it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies or i i promise thee but is there any else longs to feel this broken music in his sides   is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking   shall we see this wrestling cousin  you must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it yonder sure they are coming   let us now stay and see it come on   since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness is yonder the man  even he madam alas   he is too young   yet he looks successfully how now daughter and cousin   are you crept hither to see the wrestling  ay my liege so please you give us leave you will take little delight in it i can tell you there is such odds in the man   in

the challenger the princes call for you i attend them with all respect and duty young man have you challenged charles the wrestler  no fair princess he is the general challenger   i come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years you have seen cruel proof of this man s strength   if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt do young sir   your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial   wherein if i be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that is willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty the little strength that i have i would it were with you and mine to eke out hers fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you  your heart s desires be with you  come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth  ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working you shall try but one fall no i warrant

house but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth  i would thou hadst told me of another father were i my father coz would i do this  i am more proud to be sir rowland s son his youngest son and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to frederick my father lov d sir rowland as his soul and all the world was of my father s mind  had i before known this young man his son i should have given him tears unto entreaties ere he should thus have ventur d gentle cousin let us go thank him and encourage him  my father s rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart sir you have well deserv d  if you do keep your promises in love but justly as you have exceeded all promise your mistress shall be happy gentleman wear this for me one out of suits with fortune that could give more but that her hand lacks means shall we go coz  ay fare you well fair gentleman can i not say i thank you   my better parts are all thrown down and that which here stands up is but a quintain a mere lifeless block he calls us back   my pride fell with my fortunes i ll ask him what he would did you call sir  sir you have wrestled well and overthrown more than your enemies will you go coz  have with you fare you well what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue  i cannot speak to her yet she urg d conference o poor orlando thou art overthrown  or charles or something weaker masters thee good sir i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place albeit you have deserv d high commendation true applause and love yet such is now the duke s condition that he misconstrues all that you have done the duke is humorous   what he is indeed more suits you to conceive than i to speak of i thank you sir and pray you tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling  neither his daughter if we judge by manners  but yet indeed the smaller is his daughter  the other is daughter to the banish d duke and here detain d by her usurping uncle to keep his daughter company whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters but i can tell you that of late this duke hath ta en displeasure  gainst his gentle niece grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father s sake and on my life his malice  gainst the lady will suddenly break forth sir fare you well  hereafter in a better world than this i shall desire more love and knowledge of you i rest much bounden to you   fare you well thus must i from the smoke into the smother from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother but heavenly rosalind  why cousin

cousins laid up when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any but is all this for your father  no some of it is for my child s father  o how full of briers is this working

my heart hem them away i would try if i could cry  hem   and have him come come wrestle with thy affections o   they take the part of a better wrestler than myself  o a good wish upon you   you will try in time in despite of a fall but turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest   is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland s youngest son  the duke my father loved his father dearly doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly   by this kind of chase i should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate not orlando no faith hate him not for my sake why should i not   doth he not deserve well  let me love him for that and do you love him because i do look here comes the duke with his eyes full of anger mistress dispatch you with your safest haste and get you from our court me uncle  you cousin  within these ten days if that thou be st found so near our public court as twenty miles thou diest for it i do beseech your grace let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires if that i do not dream or be not frantic as i do trust i am not then dear uncle never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness thus do all traitors  if their purgation did consist in words they are as innocent as grace itself  let it suffice thee that i trust thee not yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor  tell me whereon the likelihood depends thou art thy father s daughter there s enough so was i when your highness took his dukedom so was i when your highness banish d him treason is not inherited my lord or if we did derive it from our friends what s that to me   my father was no traitor  then good

have her stay  it was your pleasure and your own remorse i was too young that time to value her but now i know her   if she be a traitor why so am i we still have slept together rose at an instant learn d play d eat together and wheresoe er we went like juno s swans still we went coupled and inseparable she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness her very silence and her patience speak to the people and they pity her thou art a fool   she robs thee of thy name and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone then open not thy lips  firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have pass d upon her she is banish d pronounce that sentence then on me my liege  i cannot live out of her company you are a fool you niece provide yourself  if you outstay the time upon mine honour and in the greatness of my word you die o my poor rosalind   whither wilt thou go  wilt thou change fathers   i will give thee mine i charge thee be not thou more griev d than i am i have more cause thou hast not cousin prithee be cheerful know st thou not the duke hath banish d me his daughter  that he hath not no hath not   rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one  shall we be sunder d   shall we part sweet girl  no   let my father seek another heir therefore devise with me how we may fly whither to go and what to bear with us  and do not seek to take your change upon you to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale say what thou canst i ll go along with thee why whither shall we go  to seek my uncle in the forest of arden alas what danger will it be to us maids as we are to travel forth so far  beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold i ll put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face the like do you   so shall we pass along and never stir assailants were it not better because that i am more than common tall that i did suit me all points like a man  a gallant curtle axe upon my thigh a boar spear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden woman s fear there will we ll have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances what shall i call thee when thou art a man  i ll have no worse a name than jove s own page and therefore look you call me ganymede but what will you be call d  something that hath a reference to my state  no longer celia but aliena but cousin what if we assay d to steal the clownish fool out of your father s court  would he not be a comfort to our travel  he ll go along o er the wide world with me leave me alone to woo him let s away and get our jewels and our wealth together devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment now my co mates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp   are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court  here feel we but the penalty of adam the seasons  difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter s wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say  this is no flattery   these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am   sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in every thing i would not change it happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style come shall we go and kill us venison  and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gor d indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish d you to day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequester d stag that from the hunters  aim had ta en a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heav d forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears cours d one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears but what said jaques  did he not moralize this spectacle  o yes into a thousand similes first for his weeping into the needless stream  poor deer   quoth he  thou mak st a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much    then being there alone left and abandon d of his velvet friends   tis right   quoth he  thus misery doth part the flux of company    anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him  ay   quoth jaques  sweep on you fat and greasy citizens  tis just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there    thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what s worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign d and native dwelling place and did you leave him in this contemplation  we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then he s full of matter i ll bring you to him straight can it be possible that no man saw them  it cannot be   some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this i cannot hear of any that did see her the ladies her attendants of her chamber saw her a bed and in the morning early they found the bed untreasur d of their mistress my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh is also missing hisperia the princess  gentlewoman confesses that she secretly o erheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles and she believes wherever they are gone that youth is surely in their company send to his brother fetch that gallant hither if he be absent bring his brother to me i ll make him find him do this suddenly and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways who s there  what   my young master   o my gentle master  o my sweet master   o you memory of old sir rowland   why what make you here  why are you virtuous   why do people love you  and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant  why would you be so fond to overcome the bony priser of the humorous duke  your praise is come too swiftly home before you know you

good adam i think he be transform d into a beast for i can nowhere find him like a man my lord he is but even now gone hence  here was he merry hearing of a song if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres go seek him   tell him i would speak with him he saves my labour by his own approach why how now monsieur   what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company  what you look merrily  a fool a fool   i met a fool i  the forest a motley fool a miserable world  as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and bask d him in the sun and rail d on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool  good morrow fool   quoth i  no sir   quoth he  call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune   and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lack lustre eye says very wisely  it is ten o clock thus may we see   quoth he  how the world wags   tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more  twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale   when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial o noble fool  a worthy fool   motley s the only wear what fool is this  o worthy fool   one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places cramm d with observation the which he vents in mangled forms o that i were a fool  i am ambitious for a motley coat thou shalt have one it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have  and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh and why sir must they so  the  why  is plain as way to parish church  he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise man s folly is anatomiz d even by the squandering glances of the fool invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th  infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine fie on thee   i can tell what thou wouldst do what for a counter would i do but good  most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin  for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all the embossed sores and headed evils that thou with licence of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party  doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the weary very means do ebb  what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders  who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour  or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech  there then how then   what then   let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong d him   if it do him right then he hath wrong d himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild goose flies unclaim d of any man but who comes here  forbear and eat no more why i have eat none yet nor shalt not till necessity be serv d of what kind should this cock come of  art thou thus bolden d man by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seem st so empty  you touch d my vein at first   the thorny point of bare distress hath ta en from me the show of smooth civility yet i am inland bred and know some nurture but forbear i say  he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered an you will not be answered with reason i must die what would you have   your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness i almost die for food and let me have it sit down and feed and welcome to our table speak you so gently   pardon me i pray you  i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whate er you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have look d on better days if ever been where bells have knoll d to church if ever sat at any good man s feast if ever from your eyelids wip d a tear and know what  tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be  in the which hope i blush and hide my sword true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knoll d to church and sat at good men s feasts and wip d our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engender d and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minister d then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limp d in pure love   till he be first suffic d oppress d with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit go find him out and we will nothing waste till you return i thank ye and be bless d for your good comfort  thou seest we are not all alone unhappy  this wide and universal theatre presents more woful pageants than the scene wherein we play in all the world s a stage and all the men and women merely players  they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurse s arms and then the whining school boy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woful ballad made to his mistress  eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon s mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lin d with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper d pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well sav d a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness

shepherd s life master touchstone  truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd s life it is naught in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious as it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach hast any philosophy in thee shepherd  no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred such a one is a natural philosopher wast ever in court shepherd  no truly then thou art damned nay i hope truly thou art damned like an ill roasted egg all on one side for not being at court   your reason why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest good manners if thou never sawest good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation thou art in a parlous state shepherd not a whit touchstone   those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds instance briefly come instance why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy why do not your courtier s hands sweat   and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man   shallow shallow a better instance i say come besides our hands are hard your lips will feel them the sooner   shallow again a more sounder instance come and they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar   the courtier s hands are perfumed with civet most shallow man   thou worms meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed   learn of the wise and perpend   civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat mend the instance shepherd you have too courtly a wit for me   i ll rest wilt thou rest damned   god help thee shallow man   god make incision in thee   thou art raw sir i am a true labourer   i earn that i eat get that i wear owe no man hate envy no man s happiness glad of other men s good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell wether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked pated old cuckoldy ram out of all reasonable match if thou be st not damned for this the devil himself will have no shepherds   i cannot see else how thou shouldst  scape here comes young master ganymede my new mistress s brother from the east to western

good people    how now   back friends   shepherd go off a little   go with him sirrah come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage didst thou hear these verses  o yes i heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear that s no matter   the feet might bear the verses ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees  i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what i found on a palm tree   i was never so be rimed since pythagoras  time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember trow you who hath done this  is it a man  and a chain that you once wore about his neck change you colour  i prithee who  o lord lord   it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter nay but who is it  is it possible  nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is o wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful   and yet again wonderful   and after that out of all whooping  good my complexion   dost thou think though i am caparison d like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition   one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouth d bottle either too much at once or none at all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings so you may put a man in your belly is he of god s making   what manner of man   is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard  nay he hath but a little beard why god will send more if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin it is young orlando that tripped up the wrestler s heels and your heart both in an instant nay but the devil take mocking   speak sad brow and true maid i  faith coz  tis he orlando  orlando alas the day   what shall i do with my doublet and hose   what did he when thou sawest him   what said he   how looked he   wherein went he   what makes he here   did he ask for me   where remains he   how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see him again   answer me in one word you must borrow me gargantua s mouth first    tis a word too great for any mouth of this age s size to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man s apparel   looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled  it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn it may well be called jove s tree when it drops forth such fruit give me audience good madam proceed there lay he stretch d along like a wounded knight though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground cry  holla    to thy tongue i prithee it curvets unseasonably he was furnish d like a hunter o ominous   he comes to kill my heart i would sing my song without a burthen   thou

but good faith i had as lief have been myself alone and so had i but yet for fashion  sake i thank you too for your society god be wi  you   let s meet as little as we can i do desire we may be better strangers i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favouredly rosalind is your love s name  yes just i do not like her name there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened what stature is she of  just as high as my heart you are full of pretty answers have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths  wives and conn d them out of rings  not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions you have a nimble wit   i think  twas made of atalanta s heels will you sit down with me   and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults the worst fault you have is to be in love  tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue i am weary of you by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you he is drowned in the brook   look but in and you shall see him there i shall see mine own figure which i take to be either a fool or a cipher i ll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester  very well   what would you  i pray you what is t o clock  you should ask me what time o  day there s no clock in the forest then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock and why not the swift foot of time   had not that been as proper  by no means sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons i ll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal i prithee who doth he trot withal  marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a se nnight time s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year who ambles time withal  with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal who doth he gallop withal  with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there who stays it still withal  with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves where dwell you pretty youth  with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat are you native of this place  as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling i have been told so of many   but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women  there were none principal they were all like one another as half pence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it i prithee recount some of them no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving  rosalind  on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind   if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him i am he that is so love shaked i pray you tell me your remedy there is none of my uncle s marks upon you   he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner what were his marks  a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not   but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother s revenue then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation but you are no such man   you are rather point device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love me believe it   you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired  i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he but are you so much in love as your rimes speak  neither rime nor reason can express how much love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel did you ever cure any so  yes one and in this manner he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me   at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep s heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t i would not be cured youth i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me now by the faith of my love i will   tell me where it is go with me to it and i ll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live will you go  with all my heart good youth nay you must call me rosalind come sister will you go  come apace good audrey   i will fetch up your goats audrey and how audrey   am i the man yet   doth my simple feature content you  your features   lord warrant us   what features  i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths o knowledge ill inhabited worse than jove in a thatch d house  when a man s verses cannot be understood nor a man s good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room truly i would the gods had made thee poetical i do not know what  poetical  is is it honest in deed and word   is it a true thing  no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical  i do truly for thou swearest to me thou art honest   now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign would you not have me honest  no truly unless thou wert hard favour d for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar a material fool well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul well praised be the gods for thy foulness   sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us i would fain see this meeting well the gods give us joy  amen a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn beasts but what though   courage   as horns are odious they are necessary it is said  many a man knows no end of his goods    right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them well that is the dowry of his wife  tis none of his own getting horns   even so poor men alone   no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man therefore blessed   no   as a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is a horn more precious than to want here comes sir oliver sir oliver martext you are well met   will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel  is there none here to give the woman  i will not take her on gift of any man truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful proceed proceed   i ll give her good even good master what ye call t how do you sir   you are very well met   god  ild you for your last company   i am very glad to see you   even a toy in hand here sir   nay pray be covered will you be married motley  as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar   get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is   this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another   for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife go thou with me and let me counsel thee come sweet audrey  we must be married or we must live in bawdry farewell good master oliver   not o sweet oliver  o brave oliver  leave me not behind thee  but wind away begone i say i will not to wedding with thee  tis no matter   ne er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling never talk to me   i will weep do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man but have i not cause to weep  as good cause as one would desire therefore weep his very hair is of the dissembling colour something browner than judas s marry his kisses are judas s own children i  faith his hair is of a good colour an excellent colour   your chesnut was ever the only colour and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana   a nun of winter s sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not  nay certainly there is no truth in him do you think so  yes   i think he is not a pick purse nor a horse stealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm eaten nut not true in love  yes when he is in but i think he is not in you have heard him swear downright he was  was  is not  is    besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmers of false reckonings he attends here in the forest on the duke your father i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando  o that s a brave man   he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose but all s brave that youth mounts and folly guides who comes here  mistress and master you have oft inquir d after the shepherd that complain d of love who you saw sitting by me on the turf praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress well and what of him  if you will see a pageant truly play d between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain go hence a little and i shall conduct you if you will mark it o   come let us remove  the sight of lovers feedeth those in love bring us to this sight and you shall say i ll prove a busy actor in their play sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe  say that you love me not but say not so in bitterness the common executioner whose heart the accustom d sight of death makes hard falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon   will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops  i would not be thy executioner  i fly thee for i would not injure thee thou tell st me there is murder in mine eye   tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frail st and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be call d tyrants butchers murderers  now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swound why now fall down or if thou canst not o   for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean but upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is no force in eyes that can do hurt o dear phebe if ever as that ever may be near you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that love s keen arrows make but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee and why i pray you   who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched   what though you have no beauty as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless  why what means this   why do you look on me  i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature s sale work od s my little life  i think she means to tangle my eyes too no faith proud mistress hope not after it   tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain  you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman    tis such fools as you that make the world full of ill favour d children   tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her but mistress know yourself   down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man s love  for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy love him take his offer  foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer so take her to thee shepherd fare you well sweet youth i pray you chide a year together  i had rather hear you chide than this man woo he s fallen in love with her foulness and she ll fall in love with my anger if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i ll sauce her with bitter words why look you so upon me  for no ill will i bear you i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine  besides i like you not if you will know my house  tis at the tuft of olives here hard by will you go sister   shepherd ply her hard come sister shepherdess look on him better and be not proud   though all the world could see none could be so abus d in sight as he come to our flock dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might   who ever lov d that lov d not at first sight    sweet phebe ha   what sayst thou silvius  sweet phebe pity me why i am sorry for thee gentle silvius wherever sorrow is relief would be  if you do sorrow at my grief in love by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermin d thou hast my love   is not that neighbourly  i would have you why that were covetousness silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love  but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and i ll employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ d so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps   loose now and then a scatter d smile and that i ll live upon know st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile  not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of think not i love him though i ask for him  tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well but what care i for words   yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear it is a pretty youth   not very pretty  but sure he s proud and yet his pride becomes him  he ll make a proper man   the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up he is not very tall yet for his years he s tall  his leg is but so so and yet  tis well  there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mix d in his cheek  twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask there be some women silvius had they mark d him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet have more cause to hate him than to love him  for what had he to do to chide at me  he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am remember d scorn d at me i marvel why i answer d not again  but that s all one omittance is no quittance i ll write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it   wilt thou silvius  phebe with all my heart i ll write it straight the matter s in my head and in my heart  i will be bitter with him and passing short go with me silvius i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee they say you are a melancholy fellow i am so i do love it better than laughing those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards why  tis good to be sad and say nothing why then  tis good to be a post i have neither the scholar s melancholy which is emulation nor the musician s which is fantastical nor the courtier s which is proud nor the soldier s which is ambitious nor the lawyer s which is politic nor the lady s which is nice nor the lover s which is all these   but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels which by often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness a traveller   by my faith you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men s then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands yes i have gained my experience and your experience makes you sad   i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad   and to travel for it too  good day and happiness dear rosalind  nay then god be wi  you an you talk in blank verse farewell monsieur traveller   look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola why how now orlando   where have you been all this while   you a lover   an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise break an hour s promise in love   he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o  the shoulder but i ll warrant him heart whole pardon me dear rosalind nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight   i had as lief be wooed of a snail of a snail  ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman   besides he brings his destiny with him what s that  why horns that such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for   but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife virtue is no horn maker and my rosalind is virtuous and i am your rosalind  it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind  i would kiss before i spoke nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us  matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss how if the kiss be denied  then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter who could be out being before his beloved mistress  marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit what of my suit  not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit am not i your rosalind  i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her well in her person i say i will not have you then in mine own person i die no faith die by attorney the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot mid summer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was  hero of sestos   but these are all lies   men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me by this hand it will not kill a fly but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it then love me rosalind yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all and wilt thou have me  ay and twenty such what sayest thou  are you not good  i hope so why then can one desire too much of a good thing  come sister you shall be the priest and marry us give me your hand orlando what do you say sister  pray thee marry us i cannot say the words you must begin  will you orlando   go to will you orlando have to wife this rosalind  i will ay but when  why now as fast as she can marry us then you must say  i take thee rosalind for wife   i take thee rosalind for wife i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband   there s a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman s thought runs before her actions so do all thoughts they are winged now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her  for ever and a day say  a day   without the  ever   no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed   maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey   i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou art inclined to sleep but will my rosalind do so  by my life she will do as i do o   but she is wise or else she could not have the wit to do this   the wiser the waywarder   make the doors upon a woman s wit and it will out at the casement shut that and  twill out at the key hole stop that  twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney a man that hath a wife with such a wit he might say  wit whither wilt    nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife s wit going to your neighbour s bed and what wit could wit have to excuse that  marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o   that woman that cannot make her fault her husband s occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee alas   dear love i cannot lack thee two hours i must attend the duke at dinner   by two o clock i will be with thee again ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less   that flattering tongue of yours won me    tis but one cast away and so come death   two o clock is your hour  ay sweet rosalind by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind   so adieu well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try adieu you have simply misused our sex in your love prate   we must have your doublot and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love   but it cannot be sounded   my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every one s eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i ll tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando   i ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come and i ll sleep which is he that killed the deer  sir it was i let s present him to the duke like a roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deer s horns upon his head for a branch of victory have you no song forester for this purpose  yes sir sing it    tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough what shall he have that kill d the deer  his leather skin and horns to wear then sing him home take thou no scorn to wear the horn it was a crest ere thou wast born  thy father s father wore it and thy father bore it  the horn the horn the lusty horn is not a thing to laugh to scorn how say you now   is it not past two o clock   and here much orlando  i warrant you with pure love and a troubled brain he hath ta en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep look who comes here my errand is to you fair youth my gentle phebe did bid me give you this  i know not the contents but as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it it bears an angry tenour   pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer   bear this bear all  she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as ph nix  od s my will  her love is not the hare that i do hunt  why writes she so to me   well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device no i protest i know not the contents  phebe did write it come come you are a fool and turn d into the extremity of love i saw her hand   she has a leathern hand a freestone colour d hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but  twas her hands  she has a housewife s hand but that s no matter  i say she never did invent this letter this is a man s invention and his hand sure it is hers why  tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers why she defies me like turk to christian   woman s gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiop words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter  so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phebe s cruelty she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes art thou god to shepherd turn d that a maiden s heart hath burn d  can a woman rail thus  call you this railing  why thy godhead laid apart warr st thou with a woman s heart  did you ever hear such railing  whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack   in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move  he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i ll study how to die call you this chiding  alas poor shepherd  do you pity him   no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman   what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee   not to be endured   well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her   that if she love me i charge her to love thee   if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenc d about with olive trees  west of this place down in the neighbour bottom  the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place but at this hour the house doth keep itself there s none within if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years    the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister   but the woman low and browner than her brother   are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for  it is no boast being ask d to say we are orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he  i am   what must we understand by this  some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stain d i pray you tell it when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell   he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself  under an oak whose boughs were moss d with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back   about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreath d itself who with her head nimble in threats approach d the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlink d itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush s shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for  tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead  this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother o   i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that liv d  mongst men and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural but to orlando   did he leave him there food to the suck d and hungry lioness  twice did he turn his back and purpos d so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him   in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awak d are you his brother  was it you he rescu d  was t you that did so oft contrive to kill him   twas i but  tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am but for the bloody napkin  by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bath d as how i came into that desert place  in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother s love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripp d himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recover d him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dy d in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind why how now ganymede   sweet ganymede  many will swoon when they do look on blood there is more in it cousin   ganymede  look he recovers i would i were at home we ll lead you thither i pray you will you take him by the arm  be of good cheer youth you a man   you lack a man s heart i do so i confess

that grapes were made to eat and lips to open you do love this maid  i do sir give me your hand art thou learned  no sir then learn this of me   to have is to have for it is a figure in rhetoric that

revenue that was old sir rowland s will i estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd you have my consent let your wedding be to morrow   thither will i invite the duke and all s contented followers go you and prepare aliena for look you here comes my rosalind god save you brother and you fair sister o   my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf it is my arm i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swound when he showed me your handkercher  ay and greater wonders than that o   i know where you are nay  tis true   there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams and c sar s thrasonical brag of  i came saw and overcame    for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy   and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together   clubs cannot part them they shall be married to morrow and i will bid the duke to the nuptial but o   how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man s eyes by so much the more shall i to morrow be at the height of heart heaviness by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for why then to morrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind  i can live no longer by thinking i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three years old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes to morrow human as she is and without any danger speakest thou in sober meanings  by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married to morrow you shall and to rosalind if you will look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers youth you have done me much ungentleness to show the letter that i writ to you i care not if i have   it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you you are there follow d by a faithful shepherd  look upon him love him he worships you good shepherd tell this youth what  tis to love it is to be all made of sighs and tears and so am i for phebe and i for ganymede and i for rosalind and i for no woman it is to be all made of faith and service and so am i for phebe and i for ganymede and i for rosalind and i for no woman it is to be all made of fantasy all made of passion and all made of wishes all adoration duty and observance all humbleness all patience and impatience all purity all trial all obeisance and so am i for phebe and so am i for ganymede and so am i for rosalind and so

into t roundly without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues to a bad voice  i faith i faith and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse it was a lover and his lass with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino that o er the green corn field did pass in the spring time the only pretty ring time when birds do sing hey ding a ding ding sweet lovers love the spring between the acres of the rye with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino these pretty country folks would lie in the spring time  c this carol they began that hour with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino how that a life was but a flower in the spring time  c and therefore take the present time with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino for love is crowned with the prime in the spring time  c truly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneable you are deceived sir   we kept time we lost not our time by my troth yes i count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song god be wi  you and god mend your voices   come audrey dost thou believe orlando that the boy can do all this that he hath promised  i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not as those that fear they hope and know they fear patience once more whiles our compact is urg d you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here  that would i had i kingdoms to give with her and you say you will have her when i bring her  that would i were i of all kingdoms king you say that you ll marry me if i be willing  that will i should i die the hour after but if you do refuse to marry me you ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd  so is the bargain you say that you ll have phebe if she will  though to have her and death were both one thing i have promis d to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter you yours orlando to receive his daughter keep your word phebe that you ll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd keep your word silvius that you ll marry her if she refuse me   and from hence i go to make these doubts all even i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter s favour my lord the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter but my good lord this boy is forest born and hath been tutor d in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle whom he reports to be a great magician obscured in the circle of this forest there is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools salutation and greeting to you all  good my lord bid him welcome this is the motley minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest   he hath been a courtier he swears if any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation i have trod a measure i have flattered a lady i have been politic with my friend smooth with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have had four quarrels and like to have fought one and how was that ta en up  faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause how seventh cause   good my lord like this fellow i like him very well god  ild you sir i desire you of the like i press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin sir an ill favoured thing sir but mine own   a poor humour of mine sir to take that that no man else will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster by my faith he is very swift and sententious according to the fool s bolt sir and such dulcet diseases but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause  upon a lie seven times removed  bear your body more seeming audrey  as thus sir i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier s beard   he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was   this is called  the retort courteous   if i sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself   this is called the  quip modest   if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment   this is called the  reply churlish   if again it was not well cut he would answer i spake not true   this is called the  reproof valiant    if again it was not well cut he would say i lie   this is called the  countercheck quarrelsome    and so to the  lie circumstantial   and the  lie direct   and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut  i durst go no further than the  lie circumstantial   nor he durst not give me the  lie direct   and so we measured swords and parted can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie  o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners   i will name you the degrees the first the  retort courteous   the second the  quip modest   the third the  reply churlish   the fourth the  reproof valiant   the fifth the  countercheck quarrelsome   the sixth the  lie with circumstance   the seventh the  lie direct   all these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an  if   i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an  if   as  if you said so then i said so   and they shook hands and swore brothers your  if  is the only peace maker much virtue in  if   is not this a rare fellow my lord   he s as good at any thing and yet a fool he uses his folly like a stalking horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit then is there mirth in heaven when earthly things made even atone together good duke receive thy daughter hymen from heaven brought her yea brought her hither that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within her bosom is to you i give myself for i am yours to you i give myself for i am yours if there be truth in sight you are my daughter if there be truth in sight you are
